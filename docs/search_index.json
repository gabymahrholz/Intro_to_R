About the Assessments Assistance Why are these materials open?", " Introduction to R Gaby Mahrholz, Rebecca J. Lai, Kate Haining, Greta Todorova, and Wilhelmiina Toivo 2020-03-09 About this course This course is a short introduction on using R for dealing with data. Intended Learning Outcomes The Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) for the entire course are: Demonstrate how R and RStudio work by transforming and cleaning different types of data into an appropriate format for analysis and creating graphical representations to visualise different types of data; Calculate summary statistics using R; and Interpret common error messages and use in-built help facilities to debug their code. Each chapter contained within will come with its own specific ILOs which will be clearly specified at the top of each page. These ILOs will be the points that will be covered in the assessments. What will I need to complete this course? To successfully complete this course you will need access to a computer that either already has, or you can download R and RStudio software on. This computer will need to use a Windows, Mac or Linux based operating system. You can run RStudio on a Chromebook sometimes, but the process is more complex (see here). If you cannot use RStudio on your computer you might want to consider using RStudio Cloud. All University of Glasgow Library computers should have this software installed. If you have enrolled in the University you should have access to these. After the first lesson you will be given the task of either installing R and RStudio on your own personal computer, or finding another suitable method of accessing the software. Full instructions will be given in Chapter 1 of this coursebook. If you are having issues with access talk to your tutors via the Moodle forum as soon as possible so that we can help you! R, like any skill, will get better with practice and we want to ensure you can practice and complete the assessments as easily as possible. About the Assessments Formative Assessments These assessments allow you to revise the concepts that you have learned in class. These do not count towards the course grade and, although we encourage you to, there is no requirement to complete them. These may take the form of coding assessments and/or multiple choice questions (MCQs) that will be delivered in the same format as the summative assessments - a downloadable file that you fill in the blanks of. The answers for each of the formative assessments will be available at 5pm one week after the assessment is posted. If you encounter something in the formative assessments that you want to ask a question about then please use the appropriate Moodle forum. Summative Assessments These are the assessments that count towards your course grade. There will be 5 take-home exercises to complete as you progress through this course. They will be evenly spaced across the entire 10 week span (after L2, L4, L6, L8, and L10), occurring every two weeks. You will have one week from the time of the release of each assessment to submit your answer(s). The solutions of the summative assessments will be released with the grades and feedback (see schedule below). For the summative assignments, we ask you to complete .Rmd files (either by answering multiple choice questions or producing code), and upload them to Moodle in the submission sections of a particular week. The .Rmd files and data for specific assignments will be provided in a zip folder you are asked to download and unzip before you start an assignment. The questions, whilst readable in the .Rmds, will also be posted in the Summative Assignment - questions section. It is strongly recommended to read the question page in combination with the .Rmd, as they might provide additional information (such as giving you hints what output to expect, etc.). Summative assessments will be due ONE HOUR before the start of the next class the following week (see schedule below for specific dates). We recommend that you start these early and, if required, seek assistance from the staff as early as possible. Please make use of the Moodle Help Forum. Schedule of summative assessments Summative assessment Assesses ILOs from lectures Assessment released Submission due Grades &amp; Feedback released 1 (week 2) 1 and 2 20/01 at 6pm 27/01 at 5pm 03/02 at 5pm 2 (week 4) 3 and 4 03/02 at 6pm 10/02 at 5pm 17/02 at 5pm 3 (week 6) 5 and 6 17/02 at 6pm 24/02 at 5pm 02/03 at 5pm 4 (week 8) 7 and 8 02/03 at 6pm 09/03 at 5pm 16/03 at 5pm 5 (week 10) 7, 8, and 9 16/03 at 6pm 23/03 at 5pm 30/03 at 5pm Keep in mind that the column Assesses ILOs from means that the assessment will test you predominantly on skills gained within the lectures listed (e.g. for week 4 that means lectures 3 and 4), however you will also need to use knowledge from previous lessons as your learning is supposed to be cumulative (e.g. basic knowledge from lectures 1 and 2). We will never ask you to memorise any code as this is not how people produce code in reality. You may use notes and resources you complete in class to do these assessments and consult online resources to help you. You can work together to complete these tasks, but remember that grades are given on an individual basis and that you must not plagiarise the work of others. For the purposes of your final grade, only 4 of these assessments will be counted and each will be worth 25%. The lowest score out of the 5 assessments will be dropped and not taken into account when calculating your final grade. We encourage you to complete all 5 assessments. Late submissions There will be penalties for late submissions. Your work will be assessed in the usual way, and the primary grade and secondary band will be adjusted to include reductions by two secondary bands for each working day (or part of a working day) the work was submitted late. For example, for submitting an assessment 6 hours after deadline with an assessed grade (had it been submitted on time) of A5, a penalty of 2 secondary bands reduction would result in a final grade of B2. For extensions after 5 working days, you have to submit a good cause form. If an extension for good cause has been granted, and the extension is past the date that solutions for the assessment have been released, an alternative assessment will be provided. Any blank document, or document that was submitted in a format other than an R Markdown file ending in .Rmd, will be considered as not submitted. How to Submit Your Assessments An .Rmd file to complete each summative assessment will be provided to you. In this file, you will be provided with code chunks in which to type your answers. Once you have provided code in all of the appropriate slots you will then upload this file to the appropriate assessment submission page on Moodle. Formative assessments are not to be uploaded to Moodle. You will be provided an answer key to which you can compare your own answers. If you have questions about either your own answers or those provided by the tutors then please ask about it on the appropriate Moodle forum. Assistance You can ask questions on the Moodle Forum that accompanies this course. We ask that you do not post solutions to assessments here and any solutions posted will be removed. Why are these materials open? These materials have been adapted from various sources. Some of these materials have been Open Educational Materials with CC-BY-SA licenses. This means that any materials that use them must also be made open (SA means “share alike”). We also believe in the value of open educational materials. Your course fees contribute to the development of this course, but also to providing you with lectures, supporting staff and certification and credits at the end of the course. "],

Able to describe R and Studio, the coding environment and the associated file types. Able to install, load and describe the nature of R packages and describe the nature and use of functions in general. This lesson is led by Rebecca Lai. 1.1 Computer Literacy Basics In order to successfully navigate this course there are a number of things that you need to know about computers more generally. This section here should be everything that you are required to know or learn. We are aware that many people will have been using computers for many years, and in some cases many people will have grown up with them in their household. We have noticed, however, that a number of our incoming students are not familiar with many of the basic concepts that are required to be a successful coder. There is an assumption that “digital native” automatically equates to “computer literate” but in many cases we have found this assumption to be incorrect. More people than ever before are using some sort of personal computing device, but the type of use differs greatly from what we are going to be doing over the next 10 weeks. Many mobile phones, tablets and (increasingly) PC operating systems hide many of their operations from users. This can create a feeling of compentency with computers that can quickly dissolve when asked to engage with anything slightly more complex. If you already know most of this then we apologise, but there may well be people with us who don’t. This is a beginner class, so we thought it prudent to start us all off on the same footing. 1.2 R and R Studio Are they different? Yes! Is this important? Yes! 1.2.1 R R is a programming language and completely free software, and it is widely used for data analysis. It is a stand-alone program and can be run on it’s own without R Studio, but it’s not particularly user friendly. 1.2.2 RStudio IDE RStudio IDE (short for Integrated Development Environment) is essentially a shiny facade, which sits atop R and gives it all sorts of useful features and makes it much easier to use. When you first open it you get 3 main panels, which can be seen in the picture below. 1.2.2.1 Console This is essentially the same thing as R commander. You can run code in here, and it can be a useful playground to try out new things and do things that you don’t neccessarily want saved into a script because it’s not permanent- anything typed here will be lost when you close R! Examples of things you might want to run in the console include, but are not limited to, running new functions and seeing what they do, or installing packages (never EVER done in a script). This is what the console looks like before you have run any code: 1.2.2.2 Environment/History/Connections This panel is tabbed, with 2 tabs that you need to pay particular attention to right now: Environment: this contains all of the virtual “objects” that you have created. These include, but are not limited to, variables containing data that you have read in, lists, individual values, custom-written functions. Objects can and should be created in your scripts. When you close R you might lose some of the objects, but as long as you have the script containing the instructions to re-create these objects you can re-run it and make them again. History: this is a list of all of the commands that you have run in the past “session”, which can be useful to go back to some times if you did run some code in the console that you want to look at again. To scroll through you can put the cursor in the console window and use up and down keys. At this point you don’t really need to worry about the one called connections (it lets you connect to things like online data sources and stuff). This is what that panel looks like for me right now… it’s empty! 1.2.2.3 Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer This panel set is going to be mega-useful to you throughout the duration of your career as an R user. Viewer is not immediately required, so we’ll just cover Files, Plots, Packages and Help. Files: Shows a file browser that let’s you look around in your file structure. helpful hint: click on the more button and “Go to working directory” to see the same files that R can see. You can load files in through this tab, but you should always strive to do it in the script! Plots: A tab that displays plots that you have made. You can navigate backwards and forwards between multiple plots- allowing you to test out new things and see the changes in comparison to each other. Packages: This allows you to look at the R packages that are installed on the machine that you are using, and the check box next to it indicates if it is loaded in from the library. You can click the box to load a package, but you should always strive to do it in the script! Help: this window displays the built in help information, much the same as Microsoft Word or Powerpoint has. You can search using the search box, but you can also type into the console. For example, if I wanted to find the help file for the library() function I would type ?library. the result is displayed in the help tab to the right. Alternatively, you can type the name of the function you want help with into the search box in the help tab: Sometimes these files are not exactly written in a manner that could be considered accessible to novice users. You get the hang of reading them over time. In this case you might want to try Googling it… we all do it, no matter our level of experience! Even Googling can be difficult, but you will eventually get a better idea of the types of search terms most likely to direct you to the information that you are after. 1.3 R, R Studio and Associated File Types When you open a program, such as Microsoft Word, you haven’t actually created a Word document you’ve just started the program. Opening RStudio is much the same. Even though it can function without opening a file, there is much utility to be added by opening a file. When you open a file, the console will shrink and the space taken away in the window will be taken up by the new file. Opening a new file allows you to write code that can be saved, amended, shared etc. Code sharing is an important aspect of reproducibility! R can handle a lot of different files types, we will only focus on the two kinds that we learned about in the first semester. These are .r and .Rmd files. Both are saved as plain text files. Many of the files R uses are plain text files at their core. What changes is how R interprets the files, and the types of outputs that you can get from them. 1.3.1 File Structure/Directories Your files should be stored in something called “directories”. This is the technical name for a folder. It is a storage space on your computer. Here you can see all of the files contained within the folder for this course document in the “File Explorer”, the programme used to view files and folders in Windows: Each folder and the files within will have a specific “file path”, an address within your file storage system that allows you and the computer to pinpoint the location of the information that you and it need to perform tasks involving that file. In windows you can get the file path of a folder by clicking on the bar at the top of the folder when you are looking in it in the file explorer: This will be neccessary later when you start to use RStudio in conjunction with external files, such as data files. 1.3.2 File Extensions Files come in different types, and each different type comes with a different file extension, meaning that it is associated with a different type of program. A file extension is that part after a full-stop in the file name. Some common ones are: .xlsx: a spreadsheet file associated with Microsoft Excel .docx: a formatted text document associated with Microsoft Word .pdf: a Portable Document File, commonly text and images, associated with Adobe Acrobat .txt: a plain text file, can be opened in multiple programs such as Notepad or other word processing software. .zip: a compressed folder which can contain many files. These files must be uncompressed/extracted before you use them successfully. 1.3.3 .zip Files In this course we will often ask you to download a folder with multiple files and this will be stored on the server as a zip file. A zip file is a folder that contains files that have been compressed to make the file size smaller and enables you to download multiple files at once, however, before you use the files from a zip folder you first need to extract them. Click on the link to download the compressed folder. Navgiate to the zip file (probably in your downloads folder) and open it. You will see all the files it contains but don’t use these - click “Extract all” on the top ribbon. You will be asked to select a location to save the unzipped files. Normally the default location it suggests will be the same folder and so you can just click “Extract”. If you want to unzip these files to a different place click browse and select the folder you want to keep it in. I like to keep all the files for one project in the same folder. You can now delete the zip file and use the unzipped files. This is a really important step - if you use the compressed files your code may not work properly. This usually causes error messages relating to temporary files. Adapted from Level 1 Data Skills, (Nordmann and Woods 2019). 1.3.4 RStudio Specific Files RStudio uses many different types of files, but each is a variation on a “plain text” file. This means that all files we will be using in class will be able to be opened in Notepad or other similar text programs. The three main ones we will be working with will be: .r: an R script .Rmd: an RMarkdown document .csv: Comma Separated Values file, a common and universal type of file containing data sets. If the file extension on a file is incorrect it may not be recognised as a file to be opened with a specific program and might not work. This is particularly an issue when you are downloading your files for class. As they are technically “plain text” files, some internet browsers will download them with the extension “.txt”, or even add it on as a second one which doesn’t work! Changing the extension to “.Rmd” or removing the extra added one will solve this issue. 1.3.5 .r Files This is what we refer to as a script. It is designed to be read by R, not so much by humans. To create a new script go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. This is what will be brought up: All of the text in an R script will default to being read as executable code (that is, text which is directed at the machine). We can, however, tell R not to read it as executable code, but instead for the machine to ignore certain parts of it, by using something called comments- you will read more about these below. 1.3.6 .Rmd files These are the types of files that you will mostly be using during this class. You will be given some pre-formatted ones to complete your assessments on also. When you go to File &gt; New file &gt; R Markdown… you will be prompted to supply some information. You can do this, but don’t have to as you can change many of these parameters later: When a new RMarkdown file is opened the file isn’t empty. What you actually get is an example with a YAML header (at the top bordered with the dashes), some code chunks (in the shaded sections, more on these in a minute), text and some headers (the hashtagged blue text outside of chunks). I like to think of the way this file type is interpreted as being like a script, but flipped- the default interpretation of text aimed at humans. If we want executable code we need to prompt R to read the text in this way. This is done using “code chunks”, or sometimes just called “chunks”. 1.3.6.1 Code Chunks Code chunks are bordered by “backticks”, which look an awful lot like apostrophes but they are different! These are important as they tell R where it needs to start and stop reading. Chunks also contain “curly brackets” at the start which contains various bits of information neccessary to how the computer reads it. This includes what programming language you are writing in there (yes! R can understand other programming languages!), name of the chunk (used for a variety of reasons, such as our marking software and document indexing) and other attributes which are not neccessary to learn about right now. The chunk must have the backticks to show the beginning and end of the executable code, otherwise the code doesn’t run. You must not add any code or text to the lines which contain backticks other than the code to alter the attributes of the chunk within the curly brackets (and only if you know how to do so). If you do this the code will not run and other chunks in the document might also be affected. Hastags used inside of code chunks don’t result in headers, but rather are ignored as the comments discussed in the section about .r files. 1.4 Comments Comments can- and should- be used throughout both .r and .Rmd file types. These are anything written after a hashtag symbol (and, if using a .Rmd file, within a code chunk). This symbol instructs the computer to disregard this text, letting it know that this is not for it to interpret as exectuable code but rather it is something for the human user to read and interpret. These are handy for letting others know what each piece of code was written to do, or to inform your future self of what you were doing. Make use of comments in the code we write in class and let this function as your class-notes. # this is what a comment looks like. Anything AFTER a hashtag. # R doesn&#39;t &quot;speak&quot; natural languages so it would not be able # to understand any of this and would give errors! # comments are for humans. You can use them to put notes in scripts to # remind yourself of what is happening, or to inform people with whom # you have shared your code. 1.5 Saving your file As mentioned before, anything in the console vanishes when you close R. Any objects that you have used code to make (those things that live in the environment) should vanish too. Your script is a set of instructions on how to make those objects. If you have saved your script or markdown, you can essentially re-run it and get back to where you left off when you last saved your progress. Saving your file for the first time is as easy as going to File &gt; Save As and filling in the details in the dialogue box as appropriate: Saving changes to an already existing file is done by going to File &gt; Save: 1.6 Sessions 1.6.1 What is a session in R? A session in R is a segment of time/workspace/processor time that is dedicated to performing a specific processing or analysis task. It can be difficult to wrap your head around at first, but it helps to draw comparisons with software that we are already familiar with. Let’s go back to Microsoft Word. We can have an essay open in one window and class notes opened up in another window. Both are instances of Word, but they are dedicated to two different tasks which just so happen to be running concurrently. You can have multiple sessions open in R, but I wouldn’t recommend it because it can become confusing. We can start a new session by going to Session &gt; new session. We Are much more interested in a task which is closely linked to this idea- restarting your current session. 1.6.2 Restarting Your Current Session This can be done by going to Session &gt; Restart R, see the image above. Restarting your R session does some important things: it clears the environment of objects if R is set up in a maximally reproducible way- so make sure your script is saved so that you keep the instructions for making them again it “unloads” packages that you have called from the library using the library() function If you encounter an error with an unknown source sometimes restarting the session can clear the problem It allows you to test the reproducibility of the script that you are writing by clearing the environment and starting over with only the instructions you have provided, without the possibility of “contamination” of objects inadvertently created in other ways, such as playing in the console 1.7 Packages R is a programming language which is primarily used for data processing and analysis. As the software is open source a number of people have created extensions to the software to adapt it to their needs. These software extensions are referred to as “packages”. 1.7.1 Installing Packages There are a number of functions that we will be using in this course that are not part of the original programming language. The most common package we will be using will be one called “Tidyverse”. We will use the example of Tidyverse to show you how to install packages that you might need. 1.7.1.1 What is Tidyverse? Do not install any packages on the university machines. All the packages you need are already installed. You would only need to install packages if you are using your own machine. You must also never place install.packages() in any r script or RMarkdown document: installing it a second time can break the installation and by sharing this script you would be attempting to force others to install it on their machines. This is at best rude and at worst it can break their installation. Tidyverse is a “metapackage”- a package that is actually a collection of packages that have been bundled together. It was developed by Hadley Wickham. You can read more abut the package here. 1.7.1.2 install.packages() When you install a package, you should do this in the console part of the interface, as shown here: Types the following in and then hit “enter”: &gt; install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Note that the name of the package is in quotation marks when used here. This is not always the case! The console will then fill with a lot of text showing you what is being done. It is not neccessary to understand all of this. Look out for this message being printed in the console This indicates that the package has been installed successfully. There will be many of these messages for different packages. There may even be parts after this message if the computer determines that other “dependencies” (additional software that tidyverse requires to run) are required. Once R has stopped working (doing it’s current task) the &gt; will reappear in the console. This symbol reappearing means that R is ready for further code. To install other packages you would reuse the function install.packages(), replacing the name “tidyverse” with the name of the package you want to install. We will cover functions shortly. 1.7.2 Loading Packages Now that we have installed Tidyverse it is on our machine but it is not ready to use yet! It is easier to understand if you think about it like this: if you install Instagram on your phone you only do it once and you have to open the app each time you want to use it. Similarly, once Tidyverse is installed it is on your computer until you remove it. If you want to use it you need to “open it”. This is done by using another function, library(). library(tidyverse) This must be done before you use Tidyverse. We normally do this in the first chunk in the document, essentially gathering our tools before we start working. If you want to load other packages you would reuse the function library(), replacing “tidyverse” with the name of the package you want to load. 1.8 Functions “Function” is a word that you will hear a lot in this class. But what are they? What do they look like? what are they made up of? 1.8.1 What is a function? If I were to tell you to jump, you would understand the action I was asking you to perform wouldn’t you? But before you carry it out you might ask me a question in return: how high? This is what a function is for R… it’s a command that tells R to do something. It just does it in a way that R understands. 1.8.2 The Anatomy of a Function: names and arguments Functions are made up of elements. See the code chunk below: function_name(argument1, argument2, etc...) The part outside of the brackets is the name of the function. This tells R exactly what to do- the action to be performed. The parts inside the brackets are called arguments… these provide information to R on what to perform the actions on (and input) and can provide information on slight changes to the actions. Essentially the function name is the action to perform (jump) and the arguments give information on how to perform the action (how high). Think about install.packages(“tidyverse”) and library(tidyverse): what are the function names and what are the arguments? Which part changes when you want to install and load a different package? Once your function has taken the input and run the command on it it will produce an output of some sort. As we progress through this course see if you can spot the functions, the arguments, the inputs and the outputs. 1.9 Formative Assignment This formative assignment is an important one as it will enable you to complete your future assignments. It looks long, but it is mostly screenshots to guide you through the process of installing the required software, or a short guide on how to use RStudio Cloud. 1.9.1 Access to RStudio Please ensure by the next class that you have access to the software so that you can practice using the formative assignments and complete the summative assignments when they are issued. The first summative assignment will be issued after class next week and you will be given one week to complete and submit it. 1.9.1.1 Installing R and RStudio on Your Own Machine Unfortunately this is not as simple as installing software normally is on your computer. There are two separate things that you will need to install. 1.9.1.1.1 First: Install R Follow this link and click on the part that says Download R 3.6.2 for Windows. You will get the following pop-up dialogue: Click “Save File”. The file will then be downloaded to your computer, most likely the “Downloads” folder unless you have changed your settings. Double click to run the file. You will be asked if you want to allow this to make changes to your computer, click yes. Select your language preference, review the license agreement and click next. The following screen will be presented: Click next without changing the folder. The next screen let’s you customise the installation, but we shouldn’t need to make any changes at this point so click next without unselecting any components: Also leave the star-up options as standard and click next: Leave the start menu folder as standard: Don’t make any changes to the additional tasks part, just click next: The Install Wizard will then install R: You will be told when installation is complete: 1.9.1.1.2 Second: Install RStudio Follow this link to the RStudio website. Scroll down and press the button “Download” under RStudio Desktop- not the Server Option. On the next page press the button under stage 2, “Download RStudio for Windows”. Your download will start and you will see the following prompt: Click “Save File” when the button becomes active. Look in your download folder and double click the downloaded file. Click to allow the program to make changes to your computer. You will see this part next: Click next on this next window. Do not change the installation location. Click next: You will be taken to this screen. Again, don’t change the start menu folder location here. Click next and the installation will begin: You will then be notified when the installation is complete with this screen: 1.9.1.1.3 Opening RStudio Remember that we have installed two programs on our computer. R, which is the base program, and RStudio, which is an extension of R. The software that we want to open and use is RStudio, not R. We want the shiny interface and added features. 1.9.1.2 Accessing RStudio on University Computers If you have a student card you will be able to access computing facilities provided for students, including those in the various libraries across campus. All university computers should have R and RStudio installed, as well as the required packages for this course. You will not be required to install anything on university computers, please don’t attempt to do so because we don’t want the IT guys to yell at us. To login to the university computers you will require your GUID and password. 1.9.1.3 Using RStudio Cloud We recognise that not all students will have access to their own computers, and that some of those students will not be able to travel to campus to use the provided facilities. For this reason we recommend to those in that postition to think about using RStudio Cloud, available here. The RStudio Cloud allows you an electronic workspace, hosted by the RStudio team themselves. Navigate to the page and click the “Sign Up” button at the top right-hand side of the page. Once you are logged in you will see your (for now) empty workspace: Click on “new project” and you will be taken to this page: As you can see it is almost identical to the way the program would appear on your computer if you had installed it there. To name your project you can click the name at the top of the page and type in a new one: You will also need to upload any data files to the server before you can work with them. This is done with the addition to the panel Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer on the right- the “Files” pane now had a button to upload: Pressing this will open a pop-up box. Click on the “browse” button, navigate through your directories and identify the file you wish to upload and confirm. Then press ok. The file should then be uploaded and displayed in the files pane. If at any point you are struggling to access the required materials or software it is important that you contact the tutors at the earliest opportunity to discuss the issues you are having. We want you to do well and have a good experience learning with us, let us know if you are experiencing difficulty so that we may help you resolve it! 1.9.1.3.1 Downloading Your Files from RStudio Cloud If you are using RStudio Cloud your files will be saved on the cloud, but you will need to download the .Rmd files that you have been working with (containing coursework etc) to upload them to the assignment submission pages on Moodle. Here you can see the file myfile.Rmd that I have made on the cloud. To download it I select the checkbox next to the file and click on the “More” drop-down menu and click “export”, as shown here: I then get a dialogue box asking me if I want to name the file something different. I will stick with the original name, so I just click “Download”: Now I get a pop-up as I would when downloading any other file. To save the file ensure “Save File” is selected and click “OK”: The file will then be saved in the folder where your downloads are saved (usually the “Downloads” folder by default). You can then navigate to this file when browsing files to upload to Moodle. 1.9.2 Maximising Reproducibility and Visibility In order to set up R the way that we require, there are a few more steps. First, open RStudio and click on the Tools menu at the top of the page and click on the part that says “Global Options”: Next, a dialogue box will open. Ensure that these tick boxes and options are selected on yours and click apply: Finally, go to RMarkdown and ensure that this option is unchecked: This meaning of the first part will be discussed in future lessons, and the second will mean that graphs that you make will be in the “Plots” tab to the right of the console. This means that code will not be obscured whenever you make a graph. 1.9.3 Installing and Loading Tidyverse Use the information in the section 1.7.1.1 above to install the Tidyverse package on your RStudio installation. If you are using RStudio Cloud you are provided with a completely self-contained computing environment. This means that you can install.packages() on your virtual RStudio too as required. Load Tidyverse from the using the library() function in section 1.7.2. For now you can do this in either a new .r file, .Rmd file or even in the console. If you successfully load it you will see this printed in the console: You will be using the Tidyverse package in the next lesson, so don’t worry if you struggle with this at the moment.

You can find them on moodle. It’s a zip folder that contains an Rmd file called L2_stub and a data file in .csv format for later. L2_stub has all the code chunks listed for today’s lesson. You are more than welcome to add notes and comments to the Rmd (white chunks), however there is no need to copy any code. 2.1.2 Unzipping the zip folder The folder we have downloaded is a zip folder. R cannot handle zip folders very well, so the folder needs to be unzipped. Right-mouseclick on the zipped folder, then choose Extract All.... Copy and paste/ move the folder to your M drive (or somewhere that makes sense to you - and where you can find it again - if you are using your own computer). Check the unzipped folder contains the L2_stub.Rmd and a data file called MM_data.csv. 2.1.3 Setting the working directory It is always good practice to set your working directory to the folder you are working with. This can be done in 2 ways: In the menu, go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory (Ctrl + Shift + H also works as key short cut in a Windows environment). Then select the folder containing the data file and click ‘open’. You might not see any files in the folder you are selecting - that is fine. In the Files pane, you could navigate to today’s folder, and once there click on More &gt; Set As Working Directory. Whichever way you prefer is fine. The files L2_stub and MM_data.csv should now be visible in the Files pane. 2.1.4 Load tidyverse into the library We will be using a few functions today that are part of the tidyverse package compilation. Let’s load tidyverse in the library now, so we do not have to worry about it later on. library(tidyverse) Yay, with that out of the way, we can begin Lesson 2. 2.2 Basic data types There are plenty data types, however for our purposes we will be focussing on: data type description example character text string \"hello World!\", \"35.2\", 'TRUE' double double precision floating point numbers .033, -2.5 integer positive &amp; negative whole numbers 0L, 1L, 365L logical Boolean operator with only two possible values TRUE, FALSE 2.2.1 Character You can store any text as a value in your local environment. You can either use single or double inverted commas. my_quote &lt;- &#39;R is Fun to learn!&#39; cat(my_quote) # cat() prints the value stored in my_quote If you want to use a direct quote, you need to include a backslash before each inverted comma. direct_quote &lt;- &quot;My friend said \\&quot;R is Fun to learn\\&quot;, and we all agreed.&quot; cat(direct_quote) ## My friend said &quot;R is Fun to learn&quot;, and we all agreed. You can check the data type using the typeof() function. If you want to know which class they belong to, you can use the class() function. 2.2.2 Numeric double and integer are both class numeric. Double is a number with decimal places whereas integer is a number that’s a full number. Any number will be stored as a double unless you specify integer by adding an L as a suffix. Example: typeof(359.1) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(5) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(45L) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; 2.2.3 Logical A logical vector is a vector that only contains TRUE and FALSE values. You can use that type of data to compare (or relate) 2 pieces of information. We have several comparison (or relational) operators in R. A few of them are: More information on logical comparison operators can be found on https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/logical-indexing.html (from which the above image was modified). You could compare if two values are equal… 100 == 100 ## [1] TRUE … or if they are not equal. 100 != 100 ## [1] FALSE We can test if one value is smaller or equal than the other… 5 &lt;= 9-4 ## [1] TRUE … or if one value is larger than another. 101 &gt; 111 ## [1] FALSE Note that it works with character strings as well. (Not really important for this class though) # &quot;a&quot; == &quot;a&quot; would be TRUE as both side of the comparison contain the same information. &quot;a&quot; == &quot;a&quot; ## [1] TRUE # &quot;a&quot; &lt;= &quot;b&quot; would be TRUE as a comes before b in the alphabet (i.e. 1st letter vs 2nd letter) &quot;a&quot; &lt;= &quot;b&quot; ## [1] TRUE # &quot;abc&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot; would be TRUE as there are more values on the left than on the right &quot;abc&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot; ## [1] TRUE Question Time Run the following examples in your Console and select from the drop down menu what data type they belong to: class(1): character double integer logical Error message class(1L): character double integer logical Error message class(1.0): character double integer logical Error message class(“1”): character double integer logical Error message class(1L == 2L): character double integer logical Error message class(1L &lt;= 2L): character double integer logical Error message class(1L &lt;= 2L, “1”): character double integer logical Error message Explain this - why is 1 not an integer? Any number will be stored as a double unless you specify integer by adding an L as a suffix. 2.3 Vectors Vectors are one of the very simple data structure in R. You could define them as “a single entity consisting of a collection of things”. 2.3.1 Creating vectors If you want to combine more than one element into one vector, you can do that by using the c() function. c stands for combine or as my colleague once said, it’s hugging multiple elements together. All elements in the vector have to be of the same data type. Examples: This is a vector of datatype double. c(1, 2.5, 4.7) ## [1] 1.0 2.5 4.7 typeof(c(1, 2.5, 4.7)) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; This is a vector of datatype integer. Adding the L makes it an integer, but see that in the printout the L is actually omitted. c(0L, 1L, 2L, 365L) ## [1] 0 1 2 365 typeof(c(0L, 1L, 2L, 365L)) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; This is a vector of datatype character. c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;student&quot;) ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;student&quot; typeof(c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;student&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; This is a vector of datatype logic. c(TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE typeof(c(TRUE, FALSE)) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; We have seen what vectors look like. If you want to store these vectors in your global environment, all you need is the assignment operator &lt;- and a meaingful name for “the thing” you want to store. Here the first example reads like: “Take a vector of 3 elements (namely 1, 2.5, 4.7) and store it in your Global Environment under the name vec_double.” You can then use the name you assigned to the vector within the typeof() function, rather than the vector itself. vec_double &lt;- c(1, 2.5, 4.7) typeof(vec_double) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; vec_integer &lt;- c(0L, 1L, 2L, 365L) typeof(vec_integer) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; vec_character &lt;- c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;student&quot;) typeof(vec_character) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; vec_logic &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) typeof(vec_logic) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Funnily enough, a vector i &lt;- c(1,3,4,6) would be stored as a double. However, when coded as i &lt;- 1:10 would be stored as an integer. Don’t believe it? Try it out in your Console! Question Time Your turn Create a vector of your 3 favourite movies and call it favourite_movies. What type of data are we expecting? Pick a couple of your family members or friends and create a vector years_birth that lists their year of birth. How many elements does the vector have, and what type of data are we expecting? Create a vector that holds all the letters of the alphabet and call it alph. Create a vector with 3 elements of your name, age, and the country you are from. Store this vector under the name this_is_me. What type of data are we expecting? Explain this! # Gaby&#39;s solution: favourite_movies &lt;- c(&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;) # character years_birth &lt;- c(1953, 1975) # double alph &lt;- letters # muahahahaaaa! &amp; character this_is_me &lt;- c(&quot;Gaby&quot;, 38, &quot;Germany&quot;) # character More detailed explanations: R has Built-in Constants: letters: the 26 lower-case letters of the Roman alphabet; LETTERS: the 26 UPPER-case letters of the Roman alphabet; month.abb: the three-letter abbreviations for the English month names; month.name: the English names for the months of the year; pi: the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter Of course, the task could have been solved typing alph &lt;- c(“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, “e”, “f”, “g”, “h”, “i”, “j”, “k”, “l”, “m”, “n”, “o”, “p”, “q”, “r”, “s”, “t”, “u”, “v”, “w”, “x”, “y”, “z”) this_is_me would be stored as a character vector despite having text as well as numeric elements. Remember how we said earlier that all elements have to be of the same data type? After the next section, you will understand why they are stored as a character and not as a numeric vector. 2.3.2 Converting vectors into different data types of vectors aka funky things we can do We can also reassign data types to our vectors we have just created. For example if we wanted to turn our var_double from double to character, we would code vec_double_as_char &lt;- as.character(vec_double) typeof(vec_double_as_char) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; In your Global Environment, you can now see that the vector vec_double has 3 numeric elements (abbreviated num), whereas vec_double_as_char has 3 character elements (abbreviated chr). Also note that the numbers 1.2, 2.5, and 4.7 have now quotation marks around them. Likewise, if we wanted to turn our integer vector vec_integer into data type double, we would use vec_integer_as_double &lt;- as.double(vec_integer) typeof(vec_integer_as_double) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; In your Global Environment, see how vec_integer has int assigned to it, whereas vec_integer_as_double is now listed as num. The typeof function revealed that the 4 elements of vec_integer_as_double are now stored as data type double. However, trying to turn a character vector into an integer or a double would fail. vec_char_as_int &lt;- as.integer(vec_character) # same outcome if we tried as.double ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion typeof(vec_char_as_int) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; R would still compute “something” but it would be accompanied by the above warning message. As you can see in your Global Environment, vec_char_as_int does indeed exist as a numeric vector with 2 elements, but NA tells us they are classified as missing values. A logical vector can be converted into all other basic data types. vec_logic_as_int &lt;- as.integer(vec_logic) vec_logic_as_int ## [1] 1 0 TRUE and FALSE will be coded as 1 and 0 respectively when converting a logical into a numeric vector (integer or double). When converting a logical into a characters, it will just read as \"TRUE\" and \"FALSE\". vec_logic_as_char &lt;- as.character(vec_logic) vec_logic_as_char ## [1] &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; Question Time Remember the vector this_is_me? Can you explain now why it was stored as character? Nope, I don’t get it! this_is_me would be stored as a character vector because this is the best way to retain all information. If this were to be stored as a numeric vector, the name and home country could only be coded as missing values NA. So rather than trying to turn everything into a number (which is not possible/ does not retain meaningful information), R turns the number into character (which is possible). With this in mind, what data type would the vector be stored as if you combined the following elements? logical and double - i.e. c(TRUE, 45) character and logical - i.e. c(“Sarah”, “Marc”, FALSE) integer and logical - i.e. c(1:3, TRUE) logical, double, and integer - i.e. c(FALSE, 99.5, 3L) Solution double character integer double 2.3.3 Adding elements to existing vectors Let’s start with a vector called friends that has three names in it. friends &lt;- c(&quot;Gaby&quot;, &quot;Wil&quot;, &quot;Greta&quot;) friends ## [1] &quot;Gaby&quot; &quot;Wil&quot; &quot;Greta&quot; We can now add more friends to our little group of friends by adding them either at the end, or the beginning of the vector. friends will now have four, and five values respectively, since we are “overwriting” our existing vector with the new one of the same name. friends &lt;- c(friends, &quot;Kate&quot;) friends ## [1] &quot;Gaby&quot; &quot;Wil&quot; &quot;Greta&quot; &quot;Kate&quot; friends &lt;- c(&quot;Rebecca&quot;, friends) friends ## [1] &quot;Rebecca&quot; &quot;Gaby&quot; &quot;Wil&quot; &quot;Greta&quot; &quot;Kate&quot; Vectors also support missing data. If we wanted to add “another friend” whose name we do not know yet, we can just simply add NA to friends. friends &lt;- c(friends, NA) friends ## [1] &quot;Rebecca&quot; &quot;Gaby&quot; &quot;Wil&quot; &quot;Greta&quot; &quot;Kate&quot; NA The vector friends would still be a character vector. Missing values do not alter the original data type. However, if you look in the Global Environment, you can see that the number of elements stored in friends increased from 5 to 6. To determine the number of elements in a vector in R (rather than eye sight), you can also use a function called length(). typeof(friends) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; length(friends) ## [1] 6 Well, now we decided that 5 friends in our little group of friends is sufficient, and we did not want anyone else to join, we could remove the “placeholder friend NA” by coding friends &lt;- friends[1:5] friends ## [1] &quot;Rebecca&quot; &quot;Gaby&quot; &quot;Wil&quot; &quot;Greta&quot; &quot;Kate&quot; You can see that the length of the vector friends is now back to 5 again. 1:5 uses the colon operator: which is read as in “access the vector elements 1, 5, and everything in between”. An alternative way of writing out the above without using a colon operator would be friends[c(1,2,3,4,5)]. Notice that you need the c() function again. Just as easily, we can create vectors for numeric sequences. The function seq() is a neat way of doing this, or you can use the colon operator: again. Just with the elements in the vector above, the same logic applies here. For example 1:10 means, you want to list number 1, number 10, and all numbers in between. sequence1 &lt;- 1:10 sequence1 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 sequence2 &lt;- seq(10) sequence2 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # compare whether sequence1 and sequence2 are of the same data type typeof(sequence1) == typeof(sequence2) ## [1] TRUE # compare whether elements of sequence1 are the same as the elements in sequence2 sequence1 == sequence2 ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE Question Time What data type is sequence1? character double integer logical What data type is sequence2? character double integer logical If we were to store the output of sequence1 == sequence2 in a vector, what data type would the vector be? character double integer logical 2.4 Tibble - the new way of creating a dataframe 2.4.1 What the heck is a tibble? Do you mean table? First of all, tibble is not a spelling error; it’s the way r refers to its newest form of data table or dataframe. You can create a dataframe either by using the tibble() function or a function called data.frame(). tibble() is part of the package tidyverse whereas data.frame can be found in base R and does not need an additional package read into the library. Tibbles are slightly different to dataframes in that they have better print properties (Dataframes print ALL data when you call the data whereas tibbles only print the first 10 rows of data) character vectors are not coerced into factors (which you will be thankful for later on in your programming life) column names are not modified (for example if you wanted to make a column called Female Voices you could just do that. tibble keeps it as Female Voices with a space between the two words, whereas the data.table function would change it to Female.Voices) If you want to read more about the differences between dataframes and tibbles (and appreciate the advantages of tibbles), have a look on https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html. 2.4.2 How to make a tibble from scratch Now that you have learnt how to create vectors, we can try and combine them into a tibble. The easiest way is to use the tibble() function. Let’s say we want to create a tibble that is called tibble_year with 4 columns: The first column month lists all months of the year The second column abb_month gives us the three-letter abbreviation of each year. The third column month_num tells which number of the year is which month (e.g. January would be the first month of the year; December would be number 12). The fourth column season would tell us in which season the month is (Northern hemisphere). Remember the Built-in Constants we were talking about earlier? # Remember to load tidyverse into your script at least once (usually at the beginning) library(tidyverse) tibble_year &lt;- tibble(month = month.name, abb_month = month.abb, month_num = 1:12, season = c(rep(&quot;Winter&quot;, 2), rep(&quot;Spring&quot;, 3), rep(&quot;Summer&quot;, 3), rep(&quot;Autumn&quot;, 3), &quot;Winter&quot;)) tibble_year ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## month abb_month month_num season ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 January Jan 1 Winter ## 2 February Feb 2 Winter ## 3 March Mar 3 Spring ## 4 April Apr 4 Spring ## 5 May May 5 Spring ## 6 June Jun 6 Summer ## 7 July Jul 7 Summer ## 8 August Aug 8 Summer ## 9 September Sep 9 Autumn ## 10 October Oct 10 Autumn ## 11 November Nov 11 Autumn ## 12 December Dec 12 Winter The generic structure of each of these columns we are creating is column header name = values to fill in the rows. Here, we used the built-in replication function rep() to build the column season which is a more time-efficient approach than typing out 4 seasons 3 times. Of course, we could have written season = c(“Winter”, “Winter”, “Spring”, “Spring”, “Spring”, “Summer”, “Summer”, “Summer”, “Autumn”, “Autumn”, “Autumn”, “Winter”) instead. We can now use the function glimpse() to see which data types our columns are. This is a very handy function to keep in mind for later! glimpse(tibble_year) ## Observations: 12 ## Variables: 4 ## $ month &lt;chr&gt; &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun... ## $ abb_month &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;, &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Au... ## $ month_num &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ## $ season &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;S... glimpse() tells us that our tibble has one column that is an integer, and three columns that are character strings. If we wanted to influence which datatype the columns (something that is not automatically assigned), we can do that by using the functions as.double(), as.character(), as.integer(), etc. we have seen earlier when we were talking about vectors. For example, if we wanted to modify the integer column as a double, we would type tibble_year2 &lt;- tibble(month = month.name, abb_month = month.abb, month_num = as.double(1:12), season = c(rep(&quot;Winter&quot;, 2), rep(&quot;Spring&quot;, 3), rep(&quot;Summer&quot;, 3), rep(&quot;Autumn&quot;, 3), &quot;Winter&quot;)) If you click on the name of the dataset in your Global Environment to view your dataframe, you would see no actual difference between tibble_year and tibble_year2. However, glimpse() would tell you. If I were a mean person, and had recoded month_num = as.character(1:12) instead, you would not see it when you visually inspect the data. What would the consequences be? Question Time Your turn Make a tibble called mydata with 5 columns and 10 rows: column 1 is called PP_ID and contains participant numbers 1 to 10. Make sure this data type is integer. column 2 is called PP_Age and and contains the age of the participant. Make sure this data type is double. column 3 is called PP_Sex and contains the sex of the participant. Even PP_IDs are male, odd PP_IDs are female participants. column 4 is called PP_Country and contains the country participants were born in. Surprise, surprise - they were all born in Scotland!!! column 5 is called PP_Consent and is an overview whether participants have given their consent to participate in an experiment (TRUE) or not (FALSE). Participants 1-9 have given their consent, participant 10 has not. Solution # Gaby&#39;s solution: mydata &lt;- tibble(PP_ID = 1:10, PP_Age = c(22, 21, 24, 36, 33, 25, 21, 31, 28, 35), PP_Sex = rep(c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;), 5), PP_Country = &quot;Scotland&quot;, PP_Consent = c(rep(TRUE, 9), FALSE)) But there are plenty of other ways how this could have been done. For example: PP_ID = seq(10) PP_ID = as.integer(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)) PP_Age = as.double(22:31) PP_Sex = c(“Female”, “Male”, “Female”, “Male”, “Female”, “Male”, “Female”, “Male”, “Female”, “Male”) PP_Country = rep(“Scotland”, 10) PP_Consent = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) 2.5 Reading in data 2.5.1 from pre-existing databases R comes with pre-installed datasets available for you to use and practice your skills on. If you want have an overview over all databases available type data() into your Console. One of those datasets is called “Motor Trend Car Road Tests” or in short mtcars. If you type mtcars into your Console, you can see what the dataset looks like. mtcars ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 You can look up what all the column headers mean by typing ?mtcars into your Console, or using the help tab to search for mtcars. mtcars is a dataframe rather than a tibble. How do we know that? Answer When we called mtcars it printed the whole dataframe rather than just the first 10 rows. However, we have seen what the data in mtcars looks now, but we would be able to work with it better if put it into our Global Environment. Let’s save mtcars as a dataframe called data_mtcars, and look at the first few rows which can be achieved using the head() function. data_mtcars &lt;- mtcars # read in as a dataframe head(data_mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Notice that we do not have a column header for the type of car. The reason is that the type of car is actually the name of the rows, rather than a column itself. As you can see in your Global Environment, df_mtcars has 32 observations, and 11 variables - car type is not one of them. Adding the rownames as a separate column would be rather tricky at this stage in the course (but you could try and do it after lecture 5). Another interesting dataset is called starwars. It can be found in the package dplyr which is part of tidyverse. So, as long as you have tidyverse loaded into your library, starwars should be available to you. library(tidyverse) # if you have already done this in your Rmd, this step is superfluous starwars ## # A tibble: 87 x 13 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year gender ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke~ 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, bl~ red 33 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 Dart~ 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male ## 5 Leia~ 150 49 brown light brown 19 female ## 6 Owen~ 178 120 brown, gr~ light blue 52 male ## 7 Beru~ 165 75 brown light blue 47 female ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 Bigg~ 183 84 black light brown 24 male ## 10 Obi-~ 182 77 auburn, w~ fair blue-gray 57 male ## # ... with 77 more rows, and 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, ## # species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt; In comparison to mtcars, starwars is already a tibble (which you can see in the first line of the printout). It gives you the number of observations (87) and variables (13), the column headers, the data type of each column, and the first 10 rows of data. Again, it would be neater to work with the data if we saved the data tibble to our Global Environment. Let’s do that and call it data_SW. data_SW &lt;- starwars Again, you could use the very handy glimpse() function to see what data types the columns are. glimpse(data_SW) There are other built in datasets available, such as babynames. The babynames dataset is located in a package called babynames which needs to be installed first, and then loaded into the library before you can look at the data. Do you remember how we install packages and load them into the library? Hint install.packages(“babynames”) library(babynames) Remember that you only have to do the install.packages(“babynames”) once - before you want to use babynames for the very first time. Once you have installed it, you can use it whenever you feel like by just loading it into the library. 2.5.2 from existing data files R is able to handle different types of data files. The most common one available is .csv. CSV stands for comma-separated values. Usually, a .csv file is opened with some sort of excel programme (like Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Apple Numbers, etc.) which takes the comma separator as a mean to format everything into a nice and neat table. If you open your data in Notepad, you can actually see the structure of it. There are other file types out there, apart from csv, like tsv (tab-separated values), excel, SAS, or SPSS. However, these would go beyond the scope of this class. All of our data will be in a .csv format. Getting the data from the csv file into your Global Environment in R is by using a function called read_csv() from the package tidyverse. Since we did the house-keeping (i.e. loading in the package tidyverse into the library) at the very beginning, there is no need for us to do that again. The data you just saw in the screenshot above are from M&amp;Ms colours by bag (http://www.randomservices.org/random/data/index.html). The data table gives the color counts and net weight (in grams) for a sample of 30 bags of M&amp;M’s. The advertised net weight is 47.9 grams. MM_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;MM_data.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Red = col_double(), ## Green = col_double(), ## Blue = col_double(), ## Orange = col_double(), ## Yellow = col_double(), ## Brown = col_double(), ## Weight = col_double() ## ) As you can see, R is giving you a bit of an output of what it has just done - parsed some columns. The data is stored as an object in your Global Environment now, and we could either call the data (by typing MM_data into the Console) or use glimpse() to have a look what the data actually looks like and what data types are in each column. MM_data ## # A tibble: 30 x 7 ## Red Green Blue Orange Yellow Brown Weight ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 15 9 3 3 9 19 49.8 ## 2 9 17 19 3 3 8 49.0 ## 3 14 8 6 8 19 4 50.4 ## 4 15 7 3 8 16 8 49.2 ## 5 10 3 7 9 22 4 47.6 ## 6 12 7 6 5 17 11 49.8 ## 7 6 7 3 6 26 10 50.2 ## 8 14 11 4 1 14 17 51.7 ## 9 4 2 10 6 18 18 48.4 ## 10 9 9 3 9 8 15 46.2 ## # ... with 20 more rows glimpse(MM_data) ## Observations: 30 ## Variables: 7 ## $ Red &lt;dbl&gt; 15, 9, 14, 15, 10, 12, 6, 14, 4, 9, 9, 8, 12, 9, 6, 4, ... ## $ Green &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 17, 8, 7, 3, 7, 7, 11, 2, 9, 11, 8, 9, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5... ## $ Blue &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 19, 6, 3, 7, 6, 3, 4, 10, 3, 13, 6, 13, 7, 6, 9, 11,... ## $ Orange &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 8, 8, 9, 5, 6, 1, 6, 9, 0, 5, 2, 2, 4, 4, 12, 6, ... ## $ Yellow &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 3, 19, 16, 22, 17, 26, 14, 18, 8, 7, 11, 6, 18, 21, ... ## $ Brown &lt;dbl&gt; 19, 8, 4, 8, 4, 11, 10, 17, 18, 15, 18, 20, 13, 7, 13, ... ## $ Weight &lt;dbl&gt; 49.79, 48.98, 50.40, 49.16, 47.61, 49.80, 50.23, 51.68,... You could also have used the function head() to show the first 6 rows of the dataframe or could have viewed the data by clicking manually on MM_data in the Global Environment. Watch out, though!!! head() can be a bit misleading in that it creates a new tibble and the output reads # A tibble: 6 x 7. This does not mean that our MM_data only has 6 rows of observations!!! Viewing the data opens the data in a new tab in the Source pane but it does not show you the data types of the columns. You could, however, click on the wee blue arrow next to the data name. Now that we have inspected the data, what does it actually tell us? Question Time How many rows (or observations) does MM_data have? How many columns (or variables) does MM_data have? What data type are all of the columns? character double integer logical Always use read_csv() from the tidyverse package for reading in the data. There is a similar function called read.csv() from base R - DO NOT USE read.csv(). These two functions have differences in assigning datatypes to the columns and read_csv() does a better job. This applies to the homework task as well. You will not receive marks if you are using the wrong function. So double check before submitting!!! 2.6 Last point for today Restart R and clear your workspace. Knit your L2_stub. If it knits, it is an indication that all your code chunks are running. This is important for most of the graded assessments in the future. If it runs on your computer, it will run on ours. 2.7 Summative Homework The first summative assessment is compiled of 11 questions from Lectures 1 and 2. You can download the files from moodle. The folder you download is a zip folder that needs to be unzipped before you can work with it. It contains the homework submission file labelled GUID_L1L2.Rmd and a data file called TraitJudgementData.csv. Good luck. Check that your Rmd file knits into a html file before submitting. Upload your Rmd file (not the knitted html) to moodle. "],

This so-called data wrangling is a crucial first step in organising data for subsequent analysis (NYTimes., 2014). The goal is generally to get the data into a “tidy” format whereby each variable is a column, each observation is a row and each value is a cell. The tidyverse package, developed by Hadley Wickham, is a collection of R packages built around this basic concept and intended to make data science fast, easy and fun. It contains six core packages: dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, ggplot2, and tibble. dplyr provides a useful selection of functions - each corresponding to a basic verb: dplyr function description select() Include or exclude certain variables (columns) arrange() Reorder observations (rows) filter() Include or exclude certain observations (rows) mutate() Create new variables (columns) and preserve existing ones group_by() Organise observations (rows) by variables (columns) summarise() Compute summary statistics for selected variables (columns) These are termed one table verbs as they only operate on one table at a time. Today we will focus on select(), arrange(), filter(), and mutate(). 3.2 Pre-Steps Before we can talk about today’s data, let’s do some house-keeping first. 3.2.1 Downloading materials Download the materials we will be working with today either from here or from moodle. The zip folder that contains an Rmd file called L3L4_stub, a data file called Student_Mental_Health.csv, a data file called Anx_Emp.csv and the paper “A Dataset of Students’ Mental Health and Help-Seeking Behaviors in a Multicultural Environment” (Nguyen et al., 2019). Similar to last week, L3L4_stub contains all code chunks for today’s lesson, and is intended for you to add notes and comments. 3.2.2 Unzipping the zip folder Make sure you unzip the folder and check it contains the L3L4_stub.Rmd, Student_Mental_Health.csv, and the Nguyen paper. 3.2.3 Setting the working directory Set that folder as your working directory for today. The files in the folders should now be visible in the Files pane. 3.2.4 Load tidyverse into the library As we will be using functions that are part of tidyverse, we need to load it into the library. library(tidyverse) 3.2.5 Reading in the data Today, we will be using the following data file Student_Mental_Health.csv. This contains demographic and mental health data for 268 students at an international university in Japan. The full version of this open access dataset and accompanying publication are available at https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/4/3/124. There is also a copy of this paper in today’s data folder. Now, you need to read the .csv file containing your data into your Global Environment using the function read_csv(). Remember to store your data in an appropriately named object (e.g. student_MH). student_MH &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Student_Mental_Health.csv&quot;) 3.2.6 View the data Either click on student_MH in your Global Environment to open your data in a new tab on the Source pane or call the object in your Console (by typing the name of the object student_MH) to check that the data was correctly imported into R. student_MH ## # A tibble: 268 x 19 ## ID inter_dom Region Gender Academic Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 2 2 Inter SEA Male Grad 28 Short High ## 3 3 Inter SEA Male Grad 25 Long High ## 4 4 Inter EA Female Grad 29 Short Low ## 5 5 Inter EA Female Grad 28 Short Low ## 6 6 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 7 7 Inter SA Male Grad 23 Short Average ## 8 8 Inter SEA Female Grad 30 Medium Low ## 9 9 Inter SEA Female Grad 25 Long High ## 10 10 Inter Others Male Grad 31 Medium Low ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 11 more variables: English_cate &lt;chr&gt;, ## # ToDep &lt;dbl&gt;, ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, APD &lt;dbl&gt;, AHome &lt;dbl&gt;, APH &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; You could also view the data by using the function View(). If you are more of a typer than a mouse-user you can type View(student_MH) into your Console. This will open the data in a read-only, spreadsheet-like format in a new tab on the Source pane. Remember from last week, we can also use glimpse() to view the columns and their datatypes. glimpse(student_MH) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 19 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;In... ## $ Region &lt;chr&gt; &quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;EA&quot;, &quot;EA&quot;, &quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;SA&quot;, &quot;S... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Mal... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, ... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, ... ## $ Stay_Cate &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Long&quot;, &quot;Short&quot;, &quot;Long&quot;, &quot;Short&quot;, &quot;Short&quot;, &quot;Long... ## $ Japanese_cate &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Average&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Averag... ## $ English_cate &lt;chr&gt; &quot;High&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Average&quot;, &quot;Average&quot;, &quot;H... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, ... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8,... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8,... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, ... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95... head() would be helpful in displaying only the first 6 rows of the dataset, but remember not to get “tricked” by the number of observations shown in the output. head(student_MH) ## # A tibble: 6 x 19 ## ID inter_dom Region Gender Academic Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 2 2 Inter SEA Male Grad 28 Short High ## 3 3 Inter SEA Male Grad 25 Long High ## 4 4 Inter EA Female Grad 29 Short Low ## 5 5 Inter EA Female Grad 28 Short Low ## 6 6 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## # ... with 11 more variables: English_cate &lt;chr&gt;, ToDep &lt;dbl&gt;, ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # APD &lt;dbl&gt;, AHome &lt;dbl&gt;, APH &lt;dbl&gt;, Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; Question Time How many rows (or observations) does student_MH have? How many columns (or variables) does student_MH have? Take 10 minutes to read the data description section of the Nguyen publication in order to familiarise yourself with the variables in your dataframe. 3.3 select() You may not want to include every single variable in your analysis. In order to include or exclude certain variables (columns), use the select() function. The first argument to this function is the object you want to select variables from (i.e. our tibble called student_MH), and the subsequent arguments are the variables to keep. For example, if you wanted to keep all variables except from ID, you could type: select(student_MH, inter_dom, Region, Gender, Academic, Age, Stay_Cate, Japanese_cate, English_cate, ToDep, ToSC, APD, AHome, APH, Afear, ACS, AGuilt, AMiscell, ToAS) ## # A tibble: 268 x 18 ## inter_dom Region Gender Academic Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 2 Inter SEA Male Grad 28 Short High ## 3 Inter SEA Male Grad 25 Long High ## 4 Inter EA Female Grad 29 Short Low ## 5 Inter EA Female Grad 28 Short Low ## 6 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 7 Inter SA Male Grad 23 Short Average ## 8 Inter SEA Female Grad 30 Medium Low ## 9 Inter SEA Female Grad 25 Long High ## 10 Inter Others Male Grad 31 Medium Low ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 11 more variables: English_cate &lt;chr&gt;, ## # ToDep &lt;dbl&gt;, ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, APD &lt;dbl&gt;, AHome &lt;dbl&gt;, APH &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; Uuuuiiii. That was long and it would have taken us loads of time typing it out. There are two ways on how we could have done this easier and faster: We could use the colon operator :. Similar to last week where we used the colon operator for numerical sequences, we can use it here for selecting a sequence of column names. Here, it reads as “take object student_HM, and select columns inter_dom, ToAS, and everything in between”. select(student_MH, inter_dom:ToAS) ## # A tibble: 268 x 18 ## inter_dom Region Gender Academic Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 2 Inter SEA Male Grad 28 Short High ## 3 Inter SEA Male Grad 25 Long High ## 4 Inter EA Female Grad 29 Short Low ## 5 Inter EA Female Grad 28 Short Low ## 6 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 7 Inter SA Male Grad 23 Short Average ## 8 Inter SEA Female Grad 30 Medium Low ## 9 Inter SEA Female Grad 25 Long High ## 10 Inter Others Male Grad 31 Medium Low ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 11 more variables: English_cate &lt;chr&gt;, ## # ToDep &lt;dbl&gt;, ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, APD &lt;dbl&gt;, AHome &lt;dbl&gt;, APH &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; We could use “negative selection”, i.e. select the variable we wanted to drop by adding a minus in front of it. select(student_MH, -ID) ## # A tibble: 268 x 18 ## inter_dom Region Gender Academic Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 2 Inter SEA Male Grad 28 Short High ## 3 Inter SEA Male Grad 25 Long High ## 4 Inter EA Female Grad 29 Short Low ## 5 Inter EA Female Grad 28 Short Low ## 6 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 7 Inter SA Male Grad 23 Short Average ## 8 Inter SEA Female Grad 30 Medium Low ## 9 Inter SEA Female Grad 25 Long High ## 10 Inter Others Male Grad 31 Medium Low ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 11 more variables: English_cate &lt;chr&gt;, ## # ToDep &lt;dbl&gt;, ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, APD &lt;dbl&gt;, AHome &lt;dbl&gt;, APH &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; We also have the option of “de-selecting” more than one variable. Let’s say, we had no interest in any of the seven subscales for ToAS, we could exclude them by combining the colon operator : with the minus. Watch out that you include the minus in front of both reference columns. select(student_MH, -APD:-AMiscell) ## # A tibble: 268 x 12 ## ID inter_dom Region Gender Academic Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 2 2 Inter SEA Male Grad 28 Short High ## 3 3 Inter SEA Male Grad 25 Long High ## 4 4 Inter EA Female Grad 29 Short Low ## 5 5 Inter EA Female Grad 28 Short Low ## 6 6 Inter SEA Male Grad 24 Long Average ## 7 7 Inter SA Male Grad 23 Short Average ## 8 8 Inter SEA Female Grad 30 Medium Low ## 9 9 Inter SEA Female Grad 25 Long High ## 10 10 Inter Others Male Grad 31 Medium Low ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 4 more variables: English_cate &lt;chr&gt;, ## # ToDep &lt;dbl&gt;, ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; This only works, because they are all next to each other in the tibble. If we wanted to exclude columns ID, Academic, and ToAS that are not neighbouring each other, we would need to list the arguments separately, and insert a minus before each variable name. select(student_MH, -ID, -Academic, -ToAS) ## # A tibble: 268 x 16 ## inter_dom Region Gender Age Stay_Cate Japanese_cate English_cate ToDep ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Inter SEA Male 24 Long Average High 0 ## 2 Inter SEA Male 28 Short High High 2 ## 3 Inter SEA Male 25 Long High High 2 ## 4 Inter EA Female 29 Short Low Average 3 ## 5 Inter EA Female 28 Short Low Average 3 ## 6 Inter SEA Male 24 Long Average High 6 ## 7 Inter SA Male 23 Short Average High 3 ## 8 Inter SEA Female 30 Medium Low Low 9 ## 9 Inter SEA Female 25 Long High High 7 ## 10 Inter Others Male 31 Medium Low High 3 ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 8 more variables: ToSC &lt;dbl&gt;, APD &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # AHome &lt;dbl&gt;, APH &lt;dbl&gt;, Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; We can also use select() in combination with the c() function. Remember, c()is “hugging things together”. We would put a single minus in front of the c rather than each of the column. This will read as exclude every column listed within the brackets. select(student_MH, -c(ID, Academic, ToAS)) Remember, if you don’t save this data to an object (e.g. the original dataframe student_MH or under a new name), it won’t be saved. We have not saved any of the previous tasks to the Global Environment, so there should still be only one object, e.g. the tibble named student_MH. Question Time Your turn Create a tibble called short_MH that keeps all variables/columns from the data student_MH except from Region, Stay_Cate, Japanese_cate and English_cate. Your new object short_MH should appear in your Global Environment. Solution # Kate&#39;s solution: short_MH &lt;- select(student_MH, -Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) But there are plenty of other ways how this could have been done. For example: select(student_MH, ID, inter_dom, Gender, Academic, Age, ToDep, ToSC, APD, AHome, APH, Afear, ACS, AGuilt, AMiscell, ToAS) select(student_MH, ID, inter_dom, Gender:Age, ToDep:ToAS) select(student_MH, -c(Region, Stay_Cate, Japanese_cate, English_cate)) select(student_MH, -c(Region, Stay_Cate:English_cate)) select(student_MH, -Region, -Stay_Cate:-English_cate) This is mainly a matter of personal preference. You could also reference the position of column, rather than the actual name. select(student_MH,1,2,4:6,10:19) While it works code-wise, and seems a much quicker approach, it is a very bad idea in the name of reproducibility. If you send your code to a fellow researcher, they would have no idea what the code does. Moreover, if at some point, you need to add another column to your data, and/or decide to reorder the sequence of your columns, your code would not run anymore the way you expect it to. 3.4 arrange() The arrange() function can reorder observations (rows) in ascending (default) or descending order. The first argument to this function is again an object (in this case the tibble short_MH we created in the previous section), and the subsequent arguments are the variables (columns) you want to sort by. For example, if you wanted to sort by Gender in ascending order (which is the default in arrange()) you would type: short_MH &lt;- arrange(short_MH, Gender) short_MH ## # A tibble: 268 x 15 ## ID inter_dom Gender Academic Age ToDep ToSC APD AHome APH ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 4 Inter Female Grad 29 3 37 16 10 10 ## 2 5 Inter Female Grad 28 3 37 15 12 5 ## 3 8 Inter Female Grad 30 9 41 16 20 19 ## 4 9 Inter Female Grad 25 7 36 22 12 13 ## 5 11 Inter Female Grad 28 5 32 24 8 10 ## 6 12 Inter Female Grad 31 8 47 17 12 14 ## 7 15 Inter Female Grad 31 9 31 23 16 15 ## 8 16 Inter Female Grad 30 6 40 19 9 5 ## 9 17 Inter Female Grad 31 3 48 11 13 7 ## 10 18 Inter Female Grad 29 3 48 16 4 5 ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 5 more variables: Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; Since you have assigned this code to the same object as before (i.e. short_MH), the previous version of short_MH is overwritten. Notice how the Gender column is now organised in alphabetical order i.e. females followed by males. Suppose you wanted to reverse this order, displaying males before females, you would need to wrap the name of the variable in the desc() function (i.e. for descending). short_MH &lt;- arrange(short_MH, desc(Gender)) short_MH ## # A tibble: 268 x 15 ## ID inter_dom Gender Academic Age ToDep ToSC APD AHome APH ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 Inter Male Grad 24 0 34 23 9 11 ## 2 2 Inter Male Grad 28 2 48 8 7 5 ## 3 3 Inter Male Grad 25 2 41 13 4 7 ## 4 6 Inter Male Grad 24 6 38 18 8 10 ## 5 7 Inter Male Grad 23 3 46 17 6 10 ## 6 10 Inter Male Grad 31 3 48 8 4 5 ## 7 13 Inter Male Grad 29 1 48 8 11 5 ## 8 14 Inter Male Grad 23 3 32 9 8 5 ## 9 20 Inter Male Under 25 1 36 13 10 7 ## 10 21 Inter Male Under 18 4 26 18 4 7 ## # ... with 258 more rows, and 5 more variables: Afear &lt;dbl&gt;, ACS &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt;, AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt;, ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; You can also sort by more than one column.

Question Time Your turn Hmmm, I wish we hadn’t overwritten our original data short_MH repeatedly. Arrange the rows back to the way they were (i.e. sort by ID). Solution short_MH &lt;- arrange(short_MH, ID) 3.5 filter() 3.5.1 Single criterion In order to include or exclude certain observations (rows), use the filter() function. The first argument to this function is an object (in this case the tibble short_MH we created earlier) and the subsequent argument is the criteria you wish to filter on. For example, if you want only those observations with total acculturative stress scores of more than 72: short_MH72 &lt;- filter(short_MH, ToAS &gt; 72) glimpse(short_MH72) ## Observations: 131 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Femal... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 29, 28, 24, 30, 25, 28, 31, 31, 30, 19, 20, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 3, 3, 6, 9, 7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 13, 1, 8, 13, 9, 9, 9,... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 37, 37, 38, 41, 36, 32, 47, 31, 40, 25, 34, 39, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 16, 15, 18, 16, 22, 24, 17, 23, 19, 25, 24, 18, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 10, 12, 8, 20, 12, 8, 12, 16, 9, 16, 16, 8, 15, 9... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 10, 5, 10, 19, 13, 10, 14, 15, 5, 10, 15, 10, 11... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 8, 8, 8, 15, 13, 8, 13, 8, 4, 11, 12, 8, 9, 11, 8... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 6, 7, 7, 11, 10, 6, 9, 12, 13, 6, 11, 7, 5, 7, 6... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 4, 4, 3, 6, 6, 6, 4, 8, 2, 4, 8, 4, 2, 6, 4, 4, 8... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 21, 31, 29, 40, 33, 30, 26, 30, 22, 22, 37, 23, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 75, 82, 83, 127, 109, 92, 95, 112, 74, 94, 123, ... Since the column ToAS has numeric values with no decimal places, we could have coded this as filter(short_MH, ToAS &gt;= 73). Don’t believe it? Try it out in your Console. Notice how we saved the new data under a different object name (short_MH72). When using filter(), you should never replace/ overwrite your original data unless you know exactly what you are doing. What could be the consequences? By the way, what do symbols such &gt; and &gt;= remind you of??? (hint: something we covered last week?) Answers Consequences: You could potentially lose some data. Nothing is ever completely lost though (unless you are overwriting the original .csv file) but it could result in more work for you to restore everything from the beginning. Especially when your data scripts are very long and analysis is complex (i.e. taking up a lot of computing power), that could easily turn into a nightmare. Remember the relational operators that returned logical values of either TRUE or FALSE? Relational operators (such as ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;=) compare two numerical expressions and return a Boolean variable: a variable whose value is either 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE). So, essentially, filter() includes any observations (rows) for which the expression evaluates to TRUE, and excludes any for which it evaluates to FALSE. In the previous example, filter() sifted through 268 observations, keeping rows containing total acculturative stress scores more than 72 and rejecting those with scores less than or equal to 72. This works as well for columns of the data type character. If you want only those observations for international students (as opposed to domestic students), you could use the equivalence operator ==. Be aware that a single equals sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable whereas a double equals sign (==) is used to check whether two values are equal. short_MH_inter &lt;- filter(short_MH, inter_dom == &quot;Inter&quot;) Here, the filter() function compares every single value in the column inter_dom of the data object short_HM with the character string written on the right-hand side of the equation (“Inter”). Another way to produce the exact same outcome, would be to exclude domestic students using the ‘not equals’ operator !=. Here filter() keeps every row in which the value does not read “Dom”. short_MH_inter2 &lt;- filter(short_MH, inter_dom != &quot;Dom&quot;) You can view short_MH_inter and short_MH_inter2 in a tab, use glimpse(), or call the variable in the Console to check that are actually identical. glimpse(short_MH_inter) ## Observations: 201 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... glimpse(short_MH_inter2) ## Observations: 201 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... 3.5.2 Multiple criteria More often than not, you will need to filter based on multiple criteria. For that you have the options of AND and OR. ANDis used if you had two criteria and only wanted data returned when both criteria are met. ORis used if you had two criteria and wanted data returned for either criterion. Simple Example: Just imagine, you have data of men and women who are either blond or dark-haired. If you wanted to filter everyone who has blond hair AND is a man, all your data looks like this: Whereas, if you wanted to filter out everyone who has either dark hair OR is a woman, you would get: What does that mean for our student mental health data? For example, to filter rows containing only international students who have a total acculturative stress score of more than 72, you would code: short_MH72_inter &lt;- filter(short_MH, inter_dom == &quot;Inter&quot;, ToAS &gt; 72) glimpse(short_MH72_inter) ## Observations: 109 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Femal... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 29, 28, 24, 30, 25, 28, 31, 31, 30, 19, 20, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 3, 3, 6, 9, 7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 13, 1, 8, 13, 9, 9, 9,... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 37, 37, 38, 41, 36, 32, 47, 31, 40, 25, 34, 39, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 16, 15, 18, 16, 22, 24, 17, 23, 19, 25, 24, 18, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 10, 12, 8, 20, 12, 8, 12, 16, 9, 16, 16, 8, 15, 9... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 10, 5, 10, 19, 13, 10, 14, 15, 5, 10, 15, 10, 11... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 8, 8, 8, 15, 13, 8, 13, 8, 4, 11, 12, 8, 9, 11, 8... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 6, 7, 7, 11, 10, 6, 9, 12, 13, 6, 11, 7, 5, 7, 6... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 4, 4, 3, 6, 6, 6, 4, 8, 2, 4, 8, 4, 2, 6, 4, 4, 8... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 21, 31, 29, 40, 33, 30, 26, 30, 22, 22, 37, 23, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 75, 82, 83, 127, 109, 92, 95, 112, 74, 94, 123, ... You could have also used the logical operator &amp; (AND) instead of the comma. filter(short_MH, inter_dom == “Inter” &amp; ToAS &gt; 72) would have given you the same result as above. If we wanted to filter the data short_MH for either international students OR students with total acculturative stress scores of more than 72, we could use the logical operator | (OR). short_MH72_inter_or &lt;- filter(short_MH, inter_dom == &quot;Inter&quot; | ToAS &gt; 72) glimpse(short_MH72_inter_or) ## Observations: 223 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... As you will have noticed, short_MH72_inter_or has now observations for participants that are either international students, or students with a ToAS of larger than 72. Undoubtedly, some will fall into both categories, however, participants that fit neither criterion are excluded. Question Time How many rows (or observations) does the object short_MH72 contain? How many participants in this study were international students? How many observations would the code filter(short_MH, inter_dom == \"inter\") return? How many participants in this study were international students with a ToAS of more than 72? How many participants in this study were either international students OR had a ToAS of more than 72? If you need to filter through many different values from the same column, you can use the match operator %in%. It returns a logical value of TRUE when it detects a match and FALSE if not. Let’s make that a bit more applicable. Say we wanted to make a tibble called short_MH_age that takes the data short_MH and only keeps information from students when their Age is either 17, 20, 25, or 30. short_MH_age &lt;- filter(short_MH, Age %in% c(17, 20, 25, 30)) You could use the OR operator here as well, but it would be pretty tedious to type out. Your turn Make a tibble called short_MH_ToDep that list every participant from short_MH with a ToDep score of 0, 5, 8, 15, 17, and 25. Solution short_MH_ToDep &lt;- filter(short_MH, ToDep %in% c(0, 5, 8, 15, 17, 25)) 3.6 mutate() The mutate() function creates new variables (columns) onto the existing object. The first argument to this function is an object from your Global Environment (for example short_MH we created earlier) and the subsequent argument is the new column name and what you want it to contain. The following image was downloaded from https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/mutate-in-r/ Let’s apply this to this to our short_MH data tibble. Say we wanted to create a new column Age_double that shows us the age of our participants if they are twice as old as they are now. We will save this as a new object short_MH_ext to our Global Environment rather than overwriting short_MH so that we can compare short_MH with the extended short_MH_ext later on. short_MH_ext &lt;- mutate(short_MH, Age_double = Age*2) glimpse(short_MH_ext) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 16 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, ... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;,... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gr... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29,... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, ... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48,... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9,... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16,... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 1... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4,... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, ... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17,... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 5... ## $ Age_double &lt;dbl&gt; 48, 56, 50, 58, 56, 48, 46, 60, 50, 62, 56, 62, 58,... As we can see, short_MH_ext has one column more than short_MH. So mutate() took the value in the cells for each row of the variable Age, multiplied it by 2, and added it to the new column Age_double. Importantly, new variables will overwrite existing variables if column headings are identical. So if we wanted to halve the values in column Age_double and store them in a column Age_double, the original Age_double would be overwritten. short_MH_ext &lt;- mutate(short_MH_ext, Age_double = Age_double/2) glimpse(short_MH_ext) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 16 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, ... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;,... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gr... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29,... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, ... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48,... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9,... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16,... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 1... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4,... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, ... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17,... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 5... ## $ Age_double &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29,... So now, short_MH_ext did not gain a column (it still contains 16 variables), and Age_double has now the same values as column Age. The main take-away message here is to always check your data after manipulation if the outcome is really what you would expected. If you don’t inspect and accidentally overwrite columns, you would not notice any difference. No need to keep column Age_double anymore; we could just drop it. And we are back to 15 variable columns. short_MH_ext &lt;- mutate(short_MH_ext, Age_double = NULL) glimpse(short_MH_ext) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... If you want to add more than 2 columns, you can do that in a single mutate() statement. You can also add variables that are not numerical values, such as character or logical. Let’s have a look at the column ToDep. According to the PHQ, the maximum score for that measure is 27, and patients having a score of 20 or above count as severely depressed. More information can be found on https://www.ncor.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Patient-Health-Questionnaire.pdf Say we wanted to add two columns to short_MH_ext. Column 1 is called max_PHQ and contains the maximum score of 27 that can be achieved in the Patient Health Questionnaire Column 2 is called Dep_Severe and is of datatype logical. It contains a comparison of the value in ToDep with the cut off score of 20. Values 20 and above should read TRUE, all other values FALSE. short_MH_ext &lt;- mutate(short_MH_ext, max_PHQ = 27, Dep_Severe = ToDep &gt;= 20) glimpse(short_MH_ext) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 17 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, ... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;,... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gr... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29,... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, ... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48,... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9,... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16,... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 1... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4,... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, ... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17,... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 5... ## $ max_PHQ &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27,... ## $ Dep_Severe &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FA... For column max_PHQ, we would not have to repeat the number 27 268 times. As it’s the same number for all cells, mentioning it once sets all the values in the column to that particular number (similar to “Scotland” last week when we were creating tibbles). Dep_Severe = ToDep &gt;= 20 might look a bit alien to you, but remember that a single equals sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable whereas the relational operator (&gt;=) is used to check whether two values are equal. These can actually co-exist in one statement. Here R reads the expression as: \"compare for each row whether the cell value in ToDep is equal or larger than 20. If yes, put TRUE in the new column Dep_Severe; if not, put FALSE. There are 8 students in this data set who would categorise as severely depressed. Your turn Add a new column to short_MH_ext that is called Total_Score that adds together the seven subscales for each observation (row). *Hint: APD + AHome + … + AMiscell would do the trick. If we have done it correctly, Total_Score should have the same values as ToAS. Add a second new column that is called correct that evaluates whether Total_Score and ToAS are identical columns.

You could have also used the function select() to drop or select variable columns. For example: select(short_MH_ext, ID:Dep_Severe) or select(short_MH_ext, -Total_Score, -Correct) 3.7 Formative Homework The folder for the formative assessment can now be downloaded from moodle. Load tidyverse into the library. Read the data from TraitJudgementData.csv into your Global Environment as an object called traits_data. Look at the data. Familiarise yourself with the data (see next section, and the paper in the folder), as well as the datatypes of each column. 3.7.1 Brief introduction to the homework data For the homework assignments each week, we will be using an open access dataset into how personality is determined from voices. A full version of the paper can be found https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204991. All data and sounds are available on OSF (osf.io/s3cxy). However, for your assignment this week, all files necessary are compiled in a folder to download from moodle. The data in the TraitJudgementData.csv has ratings on 3 different personality traits (Trustworthiness, Dominance, and Attractiveness) for 30 male and 30 female voice stimuli. In total, 181 participants rated either male OR female speakers on ONE personality trait (e.g. Trustworthiness) only. The speakers were judged after saying a socially relevant word (“Hello”), a socially ambiguous word (“Colors”), a socially relevant sentence (“I urge you to submit your essay by the end of the week”), and a socially ambiguous sentence (“Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation”). Socially relevant stimuli were meant to address the listener, whereas socially ambiguous stimuli were intended to not be directed towards the listener. Each participant rated all the voice stimuli twice in all four conditions (socially relevant words (RW), socially relevant sentences (RS), socially ambiguous words (AW), and socially ambiguous sentences (AS)). The experiment was conducted online. Here is a brief summary overview of the columns in the TraitJudgementData.csv. column name description PP_ID Participant’s ID PP_Age Participant’s Age PP_Sex Participant’s Sex (“female”, “male”) Nationality Participant’s Nationality Trait Personality Trait participant judged the vocal stimuli on (“Trustworthiness”, “Dominance”, “Attractiveness”) Voice Speaker’s ID Voice_Sex Speaker’s Sex (“Female”, “Male”) Condition Speaker’s recording of socially relevant words (“RW”), socially relevant sentences (“RS”), socially ambiguous words (“AW”), and socially ambiguous sentences (“AS”) Rating Participants rated each Voice in each Condition twice (“Rating1”, “Rating2”) Response Participant’s Trait judgements on a scale from 1 - 500 Reaction Participant’s Reaction Time "],

Open the L3L4_stub file. Load tidyverse into the library. Read the data from Student_Mental_Health.csv into your Global Environment as student_MH. Deselect the columns Region, Stay_Cate, Japanese_cate, and English_cate. Store this data as an object short_MH. Read the data from Anx_Emp.csv into your Global Environment as extra_MH. This data will be needed for the two-table verbs later on. Anx_Emp.csv contains fake data relating to 267 students in the previous data file (short_MH). The column GAD7 refers to students’ scores on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) questionnaire and the column Employment outlines the students’ employment status i.e. part-time, full-time or unemployed. Solution library(tidyverse) student_MH &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Student_Mental_Health.csv&quot;) short_MH &lt;- select(student_MH, -Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) extra_MH &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Anx_Emp.csv&quot;) 4.2 group_by() and summarise() In order to compute summary statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation, use the summarise() function. The first argument to this function is the object short_MH and the subsequent argument is the new column name and what mathematical operation you want it to contain. You can add as many summary statistics in one summarise() function as you want; just separate them by a comma. For example, say you wanted to work out the mean total score of depression and accompanying standard deviation for the entire sample: short_MH_ToDep &lt;- summarise(short_MH, mean = mean(ToDep), sd = sd(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## mean sd ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 8.19 4.95 Therefore, the mean total score of depression is 8.19 with a standard deviation of 4.95. It would be interesting to break these summary statistics down into subsets for example ToDep for the males and females separately. This is where the group_by() function comes in handy. It can organise observations (rows) by variables (columns) such as Gender. The first argument to this function is the object you created last week (short_MH) and the subsequent argument is the variable you want to group by: short_MH_gen &lt;- group_by(short_MH, Gender) If you view the object short_MH_gen, it will not look any different to the original dataset (short_MH). However, be aware that the underlying structure has changed. In fact, you could type glimpse(short_MH_gen) to double check this. glimpse(short_MH_gen) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 15 ## Groups: Gender [2] ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... You can now feed this grouped dataset (short_MH_gen) into the previous code line to obtain summary statistics by Gender: short_MH_ToDep_gen &lt;- summarise(short_MH_gen, mean = mean(ToDep), sd = sd(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep_gen ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## Gender mean sd ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female 8.4 4.67 ## 2 Male 7.82 5.42 Question Time What gender has the highest mean total score of depression? You might also want to calculate and display the number of males and females in the dataset. This can be achieved by adding the summary function n() to your previous code line: short_MH_ToDep_gen &lt;- summarise(short_MH_gen, n = n(), mean = mean(ToDep), sd = sd(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep_gen ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## Gender n mean sd ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female 170 8.4 4.67 ## 2 Male 98 7.82 5.42 Question Time How many males are in the dataset? How many females are in the dataset? Finally, it is possible to add multiple grouping variables. For example, the following code groups short_MH by Gender and Academic level and then calculates the mean total score of depression (ToDep) for male and female graduates and undergraduates (4 groups). short_MH_group &lt;- group_by(short_MH, Gender, Academic) short_MH_ToDep_group &lt;- summarise(short_MH_group, mean = mean(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep_group ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## # Groups: Gender [2] ## Gender Academic mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female Grad 7 ## 2 Female Under 8.52 ## 3 Male Grad 2.5 ## 4 Male Under 8.29 Question Time Which group appears to be most resilient to depression? female undergraduates male undergraduates female graduates male graduates Luckily for you, the dataset does not contain any missing values, denoted NA in R. Missing values are always a bit of a hassle to deal with. Any computation you do that involves NA returns an NA - which translates as “you will not get a numeric result when your column contains missing values”. Missing values can be removed by adding the argument na.rm = TRUE to calculation functions like mean(), median() or sd(). For example, the previous code line would read: short_MH_ToDep_group &lt;- summarise(short_MH_group, mean = mean(ToDep, na.rm = TRUE)) If you need to return the data to a non-grouped form, use the ungroup() function. glimpse(short_MH_gen) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 15 ## Groups: Gender [2] ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... short_MH_gen &lt;- ungroup(short_MH_gen) glimpse(short_MH_gen) ## Observations: 268 ## Variables: 15 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gra... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 25, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, ... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 41, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, ... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 13, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, ... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, ... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 7, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, ... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13,... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 14, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, ... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 51, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54... 4.3 The pipe operator (%&gt;%) As you may have noticed, your environment pane has become increasingly cluttered. Indeed, every time you introduced a new line of code, you created a uniquely-named object (unless your original object is overwritten). This can become confusing and time-consuming. One solution is the pipe operator (%&gt;%) which aims to increase efficiency and improve the readability of your code. The pipe operator (%&gt;%) read as “and then” allows you to chain functions together, eliminating the need to create intermediary objects. There is no limit as to how many functions you can chain together in a single pipeline. For example, in order to select(), arrange(), group_by() and summarise() the data, you used the following code lines: short_MH &lt;- select(student_MH, -Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) short_MH_arr &lt;- arrange(short_MH, desc(Gender), desc(ToAS)) short_MH_group &lt;- group_by(short_MH_arr, Gender, Academic) short_MH_ToDep_group &lt;- summarise(short_MH_group, mean = mean(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep_group ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## # Groups: Gender [2] ## Gender Academic mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female Grad 7 ## 2 Female Under 8.52 ## 3 Male Grad 2.5 ## 4 Male Under 8.29 However, utilisation of the pipe operator (%&gt;%) can simplify this process and create only one object (short_MH_ToDep_group2) as shown: short_MH_ToDep_group2 &lt;- student_MH %&gt;% select(-Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) %&gt;% arrange(desc(Gender), desc(ToAS)) %&gt;% group_by(Gender, Academic) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep_group2 ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## # Groups: Gender [2] ## Gender Academic mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female Grad 7 ## 2 Female Under 8.52 ## 3 Male Grad 2.5 ## 4 Male Under 8.29 As you can see, short_MH_ToDep_group2 produces the same output as short_MH_ToDep_group. So, pipes automatically take the output from one function and feed it directly to the next function. Without pipes, you needed to insert your chosen dataset as the first argument to every function. With pipes, you are only required to specify the original dataset (i.e student_MH) once at the beginning of the pipeline. You don’t need the first argument of each of the functions anymore, because the pipe will know to look at the dataset from the previous step of the pipeline. Your turn Amend the previous pipeline short_MH_ToDep_group2 so that Gender and ToAS are arranged in ascending order. Only those observations with total social connectedness scores (ToSC) of more than 24 are kept The standard deviation of values in the ToDep column is calculated for males and females at each academic level Save this as an object called short_MH_ToDep_group3 to your Global Environment. Solution short_MH_ToDep_group3 &lt;- student_MH %&gt;% select(-Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) %&gt;% arrange(Gender, ToAS) %&gt;% filter(ToSC &gt;25) %&gt;% group_by(Gender, Academic) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(ToDep), sd = sd(ToDep)) short_MH_ToDep_group3 ## # A tibble: 4 x 4 ## # Groups: Gender [2] ## Gender Academic mean sd ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female Grad 7 3.51 ## 2 Female Under 7.53 3.99 ## 3 Male Grad 2.5 1.77 ## 4 Male Under 7.26 4.65 Note that in the above code chunk, the data object has been on its own line in the code followed immediately by %&gt;% before starting with the “functions”. short_MH_ToDep_group2 &lt;- student_MH %&gt;% select(-Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) %&gt;% … The other option would have been to put the data object as the first argument within the first function, such as short_MH_ToDep_group2 &lt;- select(student_MH, -Region, -Stay_Cate, -Japanese_cate, -English_cate) %&gt;% … The benefit of having the data on its own is that you reorder functions easily or squeeze another one in (for example if you summarised something but forgot to group beforehand) without having to remember to “move” the data object into the first argument of the chain. 4.4 Two-Table Verbs More often than not, data scientists collect and store their data across multiple tables. In order to effectively combine multiple tables, dplyr provides a selection of two-table verbs. Today we will focus on two categories of two-table verbs - mutating join verbs and binding join verbs. 4.4.1 Mutating Join Verbs Mutating join verbs combine the variables (columns) of two tables so that matching rows are together. There are 4 different types of mutating joins, namely inner_join(), left_join(), right_join(), and full_join(). Mutating joins have the following basic syntax: Let’s investigate joins using a simple example by creating two tibbles, data1 (shown below in blue) and data2 (shown below in green), both with only two columns, and two rows. Coded in R that would look like: data1 &lt;- tibble(ID = 1:2, X1 = c(&quot;a1&quot;, &quot;a2&quot;)) data2 &lt;- tibble(ID = 2:3, X2 = c(&quot;b1&quot;, &quot;b2&quot;)) For the following examples, imagine that X1 refers to student names and X2 relates to student grades. Let’s also imagine that X2 includes grades for students who have since dropped the course (and thus been removed from X1) and that X2 is missing some students who didn’t sit the exam. 4.4.1.1 inner_join() An inner join returns all rows from x that have a match in y, whereby x is the first (left) table and y is the second (right) table. All columns from x and y are present in the merged object. If there are multiple rows that match, all of them are returned. Merging data1 and data2 by inner_join() would be coded in R: inner_join(data1, data2, by=&quot;ID&quot;) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## ID X1 X2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2 a2 b1 Using an inner join would return only 1 row of observations because the only ID value matching in data1 and data2 is the row with ID = 2. However, we are still merging both tibbles together, meaning that all columns from data1 and data2 are kept (in our case X1 and X2). In the applied example, two students (ID 3 &amp; 4) would be dropped from the output as their ID is only present in one table and thus, is unsuitable for matching. The inner join is useful in this situation as it ensures that grades are only held for students who still take the course and actually sat the exam. inner_join(data1, data2) would have produced the same outcome. When the by statement is omitted, data1 and data2 are joined by ALL “overlapping” variable columns (in this case ID). Don’t believe it? Try it out in your Console! Question Time Let’s apply an inner join to join short_MH with extra_MH (the fake data we read in during today’s pre-steps). Before we do that, it might be wise to remind ourselves of the number of rows and columns we are dealing with in both datasets. How many rows (or observations) does short_MH have? How many columns (or variables) does short_MH have? How many rows (or observations) does extra_MH have? How many columns (or variables) does extra_MH have? Notice that: Both datasets contain a common column ID One person (ID = 3) is missing from the second dataset (extra_MH) Your turn Now join short_MH and extra_MH using inner_join(). Save your results in the Global Environment as an object called MH_inner. How many rows and columns do you think MH_inner should have?

MH_inner has 267 rows, and 17 columns. rows: The overlapping ID numbers in both dataframes are 1,2,4,5…,268 which makes for 267 values. columns: total number of columns is 15 (from short_MH) + 3 (from extra_MH) - the column ID that exists in both objects. Notice how no rows have missing values. 4.4.1.2 left_join() A left join returns all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in the left table with no match in the right table will have missing values (NA) in the new columns. Let’s try this left_join() function for our simple example of data1 and data2 in R. left_join(data1, data2, by=&quot;ID&quot;) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## ID X1 X2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 2 a2 b1 Here data1 is returned in full, and for every matching ID number, the value from data2 is added for X2. However, data2 does not have any value for ID = 1, hence NA is added in X2. The left join is useful if you want to simply append student names to student grades, regardless of whether students sat the exam or not. Students with NA values in the grade column could be offered more support and guidance in the future. Question Time Your turn Combine short_MH and extra_MH using left_join(). Save your results in the Global Environment as an object called MH_left. How many rows and columns are you expecting for MH_left?

Remember that ID number 3 is missing from the second (right) dataset. Since the first (left) dataset is prioritised in a left_join() and data1 contains ID number 3, it is retained in the new dataset MH_left and NA is added to GAD7 and Employment. 4.4.1.3 right_join() A right join returns all rows from y, and all columns from x and y, whereby y is the second (right table) and x is the first (left) table. Rows in the second table with no match in the first table will have NA values in the new columns. However, code-wise, you would still enter x as the first, and y as the second argument within right_join(). right_join(data1, data2, by = &quot;ID&quot;) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## ID X1 X2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2 a2 b1 ## 2 3 &lt;NA&gt; b2 Here data2 is returned in full, and for every matching ID number, the value from data1 is added for X1. As data1 does not have any value for ID = 3, NA is added in column X1 . Notice the order of the columns, though!!! ID, X1 and X2. That is due to the order of how they are entered into the right_join() function. That means for our student example: The right join is useful if you want to append student grades to student names, regardless of whether students dropped the course or not. In order to measure the difficulty level of your exam, you may want to calculate the average performance of all students - even those that have since dropped the course. Question Time Your turn combine short_MH and extra_MH using right_join(). Save your results in the Global Environment as an object called MH_right. How many rows and columns should MH_right have? Solution MH_right &lt;- right_join(short_MH, extra_MH, by = &quot;ID&quot;) glimpse(MH_right) ## Observations: 267 ## Variables: 17 ## $ ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,... ## $ inter_dom &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot;, &quot;Inter... ## $ Gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;,... ## $ Academic &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Gr... ## $ Age &lt;dbl&gt; 24, 28, 29, 28, 24, 23, 30, 25, 31, 28, 31, 29, 23,... ## $ ToDep &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3, ... ## $ ToSC &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 48, 37, 37, 38, 46, 41, 36, 48, 32, 47, 48, 32,... ## $ APD &lt;dbl&gt; 23, 8, 16, 15, 18, 17, 16, 22, 8, 24, 17, 8, 9, 23,... ## $ AHome &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 7, 10, 12, 8, 6, 20, 12, 4, 8, 12, 11, 8, 16, 9,... ## $ APH &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 5, 10, 5, 10, 10, 19, 13, 5, 10, 14, 5, 5, 15, ... ## $ Afear &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 5, 15, 13, 12, 8, 13, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4,... ## $ ACS &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 3, 6, 7, 7, 3, 11, 10, 3, 6, 9, 7, 6, 12, 13, 8... ## $ AGuilt &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 2, ... ## $ AMiscell &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 10, 21, 31, 29, 15, 40, 33, 17, 30, 26, 17, 18,... ## $ ToAS &lt;dbl&gt; 91, 39, 75, 82, 83, 58, 127, 109, 51, 92, 95, 54, 5... ## $ GAD7 &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 1, 0, 1, 14, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 8, 0, 6, 12, 4, 0... ## $ Employment &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Unemployed&quot;, &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;Full&quot;, &quot;Unemployed&quot;,... We should receive 267 observations and 17 columns. Since the second (right) table is prioritised and does not contain ID number 3, it is absent from the new dataset. In this case, right_join() produces the same output as inner_join(). 4.4.1.4 full_join() A full join returns all rows and all columns from both x and y, whereby x is the first (left) table and y is the second (right) table. NA values fill unmatched rows. full_join(data1, data2) ## Joining, by = &quot;ID&quot; ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## ID X1 X2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 2 a2 b1 ## 3 3 &lt;NA&gt; b2 As you can see, ID values (1,2, and 3) from both dataframes are retained. ID = 3 does not exist in data1, and ID = 1 does not exist in data2, X1 and X2 are filled with NA respectively. Since the full join is the combination of both left join and right join, it would contain all student names, regardless of whether students dropped the course or not, and all student grades regardless of whether students sat the exam or not. Thus, it can be used to tailor student support and guidance and measure the difficulty level of the exam. Question Time Your turn combine short_MH and extra_MH using full_join(). Save your results in the Global Environment as an object called MH_full. How many rows and columns are you expecting for MH_right?

We should receive 268 observations and 17 columns. All data is kept, including ID = 3, and GAD7 and Employment are filled up with NA values. In this case, full_join() produces the same output as left_join(). Hypothetical scenario In the case of the student mental health data, we have seen that inner_join() and right_join() as well as left(join) and full_join() produce the same results. Can you think of a way how you would have to modify short_MH and/or extra_MH to produce different results for inner_join()/ right_join() or left(join)/full_join()? Solution Adding data for participant 269 to short_MH and 270 to extra_MH would do the trick: inner_join() would still be the same output of 267 observations since the “overlapping” ID numbers for data1 and data2 don’t change (1,2,4,5,…,268) right_join() would prioritise the right table extra_MH, leaving us with ID numbers 1,2,4,5,…,268,270 (adding to a total of 268 observations. For ID = 270, X1 would be filled with NA; ID = 3 would not be mentioned. left(join) would prioritise the left table short_MH, selecting ID rows 1:269. For ID = 3 and ID = 269 X2 would show NA. ID = 270 would not be mentioned. full_join() would add both datasets in full, showing ID values 1:270, with ID = 270 showing NA for X1, and ID = 3 and ID = 269 showing NA for X2. All visualisation for the joins were adapted from https://statisticsglobe.com/r-dplyr-join-inner-left-right-full-semi-anti. The website also provides additional information on filtering joins (semi and anti joins) that we haven’t touched upon. 4.4.2 Binding Join Verbs In contrast to mutating join verbs, binding join verbs simply combine tables without any need for matching. Dplyr provides bind_rows() and bind_cols() for combining tables by row and column respectively. When row binding, missing columns are replaced by NA values. When column binding, if the tables do not match by appropriate dimensions, an error will result. Let’s take our simple example from above and see how data1 and data2 would be merged with bind_rows() and bind_cols(). bind_rows(data1, data2) ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## ID X1 X2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 2 a2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 2 &lt;NA&gt; b1 ## 4 3 &lt;NA&gt; b2 bind_rows() takes data2 and puts it underneath data1. Notice that the binding does not “care” that we have now two rows representing ID = 2. Since X1 and X2 do not exist in data1 and data2 respectively, NA are added. bind_cols(data1, data2) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## ID X1 ID1 X2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a1 2 b1 ## 2 2 a2 3 b2 bind_cols() takes data2 and puts it right next to data1. Since the column name ID has already been taken, column 3 gets called ID1. In the case when the dimension between the dataframes do not match, bind_rows() would still work, whereas bind_cols() would produce an error message. data3 &lt;- tibble(ID = 3:5, X3 = c(&quot;c1&quot;, &quot;c2&quot;, &quot;c3&quot;)) bind_rows(data1, data2, data3) ## # A tibble: 7 x 4 ## ID X1 X2 X3 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a1 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 2 a2 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 2 &lt;NA&gt; b1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 3 &lt;NA&gt; b2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 3 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; c1 ## 6 4 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; c2 ## 7 5 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; c3 bind_cols(data1, data3) By the way, you can merge as many data objects as you like with the binding functions, whereas in the join functions, you are limited to two. However, you could use a pipe to combine the merged dataframe with a third. example 1: bind_rows(data1, data2, data3) example 2: full_join(data1, data2) %&gt;% full_join(data3) Your turn You have finally found the missing data corresponding to ID number 3. This subject has a GAD7 score of 4 and is employed part-time. Store this information in a tibble called new_participant and bind it to the extra_MH dataset using bind_rows(). Store this merged output to your Global Environment as a new object called extra_MH_final. Solution new_participant &lt;- tibble(ID = 3, GAD7 = 4, Employment = &quot;Part&quot;) extra_MH_final &lt;- bind_rows(new_participant, extra_MH) Follow-up Question The dataset extra_MH_final now contains the same number of observations (rows) as short_MH. Use bind_cols() to merge these two datasets together in a tibble called MH_final. How many rows and columns are you expecting for MH_final to have and why? Rows (or observations): Columns (or variables): Solution MH_final &lt;- bind_cols(short_MH, extra_MH_final) We were expecting 268 observations (as both datasets have 268 rows) and 18 columns (i.e. 15 from short_MH and 3 from extra_MH_final). Notice that the ID column has been duplicated with an added suffix. Follow-up Question 2 Using your knowledge of one-table verbs, exclude the column ID1, overwriting the object MH_final. Solution MH_final &lt;- select(MH_final, -ID1) Follow-up Question 3 Rather than using bind_cols() and select(), can you think of a different way how you could have merged short_MH and extra_MH_final? Solution # One solution: MH_final &lt;- full_join(short_MH, extra_MH_final) ## Joining, by = &quot;ID&quot; Actually, any of the other joins would have worked as well, though right_join() would have sorted the column ID differently.

By the end of today, you will know How to rearrange data from long format into to wide format and vice versa How to combine and separate columns This lesson is led by Gaby Mahrholz. 5.1 Pre-steps All the functions for tidying data are within tidyverse so we need to make sure to load it into the library. Today’s lecture will make use of built-in dataframes which means we do not have to load any data into our Global Environment for the minute. library(tidyverse) 5.2 Tidy data “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” – Leo Tolstoy “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” – Hadley Wickham In this chapter, you will learn a consistent way to organise your data in R. Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund call this tidy data. In most cases, data does not come in a tidy format. Researchers spend most of their time getting the data into the shape it needs to be for a particular analysis. The tools we introduce you to this week and next should form the basics for data wrangling. The idea is that tidy datasets are easier to work with in the long run. There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy: Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. If you want to know more about tidy data, Hadley Wickham’s paper can be found on https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf or check out chapter 12 in the book R for Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html). 5.3 gather() and spread() gather() and spread() are part of tidyr (also part of the tidyverse package) and help you to rearrange the shape of your data. To get your data into long format, you would use gather(); if you wanted to get your data from long to wide format, you would need spread(). Here is a nice gif animation by Garrick Aden-Buie (https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/#spread-and-gather) that shows you how gather() and spread() work. 5.3.1 gather() We can start this lecture by looking at a practical example in the build-in dataset table1 to table5. They show the number of Tuberculosis cases documented by the World Health Organization in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China between 1999 and 2000 (the full dataset is called who). The data is part of the tidyverse package, so as long as we have tidyverse loaded into the library, there should not be an issue in accessing this dataset. table1 ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 table1 has a very tidy structure as it follows the three principles above - each variable is its own column, each observation is its own row, and each value is its own cell. You can see the data contains values associated with four variables (country, year, cases, and population). table4a however, looks a touch not right. table4a ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## country `1999` `2000` ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 745 2666 ## 2 Brazil 37737 80488 ## 3 China 212258 213766 Somehow the values for the columns year and cases are missing and instead we find two separate columns for 1999 and 2000 that have all cases values listed. This is a problem as 1999 and 2000 are actual values and not variables. What we want to do, is gather 1999 and 2000 in one column year and respective values into a second column called cases. Currently the data is in what is called a wide format. The function gather() comes in handy when we want to get the data into the shape of a long format like in table1. gather() is structured like: Let’s apply this formula to table4a We need a dataframe that we want to modify -&gt; table4a We need to come up with the name of a new column in which the values of 1999 and 2000 will be stored -&gt; year We need to come up with the name of a new column in which all the case values will be stored -&gt; cases And finally, we need to tell R which columns in table4a we want to turn into long format (i.e. the columns of the 7 subscales) -&gt; 1999 and 2000 (Note that “1999” and “2000” are non-syntactic names as they don’t start with a letter. The solution is to surround them in backticks.) gather(table4a, key = year, value = cases, `1999`:`2000`) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year cases ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 ## 2 Brazil 1999 37737 ## 3 China 1999 212258 ## 4 Afghanistan 2000 2666 ## 5 Brazil 2000 80488 ## 6 China 2000 213766 Here we have only 2 columns to reshape 1999 and 2000. We could have written gather(table4a, year, cases, `1999`, `2000`). Your turn Look at table4b. There are two separate columns 1999 and 2000 with population values for Afghanistan, Brazil, and China. Use the gather() function on table4b to reshape it from wide format into long format. Solution gather(table4b, key = year, value = population, `1999`:`2000`) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 19987071 ## 2 Brazil 1999 172006362 ## 3 China 1999 1272915272 ## 4 Afghanistan 2000 20595360 ## 5 Brazil 2000 174504898 ## 6 China 2000 1280428583 5.3.2 spread() Now onto the reverse. spread() will spread the data from long into wide format. When you have observations that are scattered across multiple rows, you can use spread() to split those rows up into separate variables. Let’s take a look at table2. table2 ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## country year type count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 cases 745 ## 2 Afghanistan 1999 population 19987071 ## 3 Afghanistan 2000 cases 2666 ## 4 Afghanistan 2000 population 20595360 ## 5 Brazil 1999 cases 37737 ## 6 Brazil 1999 population 172006362 ## 7 Brazil 2000 cases 80488 ## 8 Brazil 2000 population 174504898 ## 9 China 1999 cases 212258 ## 10 China 1999 population 1272915272 ## 11 China 2000 cases 213766 ## 12 China 2000 population 1280428583 table2 has the variables cases and population stored in one column type and their respective values in count. However, cases and population are separate variables rather than values of type. So best to get them spread out into their own columns as shown in the image below. Take a look how spread() achieves that. Let’s apply the formula above to table2: We need a dataframe that we want to modify -&gt; table2 We need to decide which of the columns in table2 will become the new column headers -&gt; type We need to decide which of the columns in table2 has all the data in it that will become the new cell values -&gt; count spread(table2, key = type, value = count) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 Voila, cases and population are in their own columns. Let me modify table1 a tiny bit. table1_mod &lt;- table1 %&gt;% mutate(percent = cases/ population * 100) %&gt;% gather(variable, values, cases:percent) country year variable values Afghanistan 1999 cases 7.450000e+02 Afghanistan 2000 cases 2.666000e+03 Brazil 1999 cases 3.773700e+04 Brazil 2000 cases 8.048800e+04 China 1999 cases 2.122580e+05 China 2000 cases 2.137660e+05 Afghanistan 1999 population 1.998707e+07 Afghanistan 2000 population 2.059536e+07 Brazil 1999 population 1.720064e+08 Brazil 2000 population 1.745049e+08 China 1999 population 1.272915e+09 China 2000 population 1.280429e+09 Afghanistan 1999 percent 3.727400e-03 Afghanistan 2000 percent 1.294470e-02 Brazil 1999 percent 2.193930e-02 Brazil 2000 percent 4.612360e-02 China 1999 percent 1.667500e-02 China 2000 percent 1.669490e-02 Your turn In the modified table above table1_mod, we added a percent column to see how much percentage of the population had Tuberculosis in 1999 and 2000 in each of the countries Afghanistan, Brazil, and China. But somehow, all numerical information has ended up in 1 column (values). Your task is to spread the data back out, so that cases, population, and percentage values are in their own columns, titled as cases, population, and percent respectively. Store the new object in the Global Environment as table1_mod_corrected. When you are done, table1_mod_corrected should look like this… country year cases percent population Afghanistan 1999 745 0.0037274 19987071 Afghanistan 2000 2666 0.0129447 20595360 Brazil 1999 37737 0.0219393 172006362 Brazil 2000 80488 0.0461236 174504898 China 1999 212258 0.0166750 1272915272 China 2000 213766 0.0166949 1280428583 Solution table1_mod_corrected &lt;- spread(table1_mod, key = variable, value = values) 5.4 separate() and unite() separate() turns a single character column into multiple columns, whereas unite() combines the values of multiple columns into one column. 5.4.1 separate() Take a look at table3. table3 ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year rate ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766/1280428583 In table3, two out of three principles of tidy data are violated. There are multiple values stored in column rate (rule 3) but these multiple values also belong to two different variables - cases and population respectively (rule 1). Here, we would use separate() to split the column rate into two columns cases and population. The function separate() is structured like this: We would need the data in which the column to separate is located -&gt; table3, the actual column we want to separate -&gt; rate, the into argument asking into how many columns we want to separate the old column and what we want to call these new columns -&gt; c(\"cases\", \"population\"), and a separator argument -&gt; \"/\". separate(table3, rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 R has put all cell information before the / into a column we named cases, and everything after the / into the column we decided to call population. / will not appear in either column cases or population. The data is now in a tidy format. By the way, the separator argument sep = can be any non-alphanumeric character, for example: underscore (\"_\"), comma (“,”), semi-colon (“;”), colon (“:”), forward-slash (“/”), space (\" \") or nothing (\"\"). But watch out! When the separator is a full stop, you would need to add a double backward slash in front of it (sep = “\\\\.”). 5.4.2 additional arguments for separate() 5.4.2.1 Retaining the original column If for some reason, you wanted to keep the original column, you can set an additional argument remove to FALSE. separate(table3, rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, remove = FALSE) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## country year rate cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258/1272915272 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766/1280428583 213766 1280428583 5.4.2.2 Dropping parts of the original column What if we were just interested retaining part of the data in the cell, for example keeping the column cases but not population. The solution would be to work with an NA argument. Defining the new columns as cases and NA will keep everything before the separator in the column cases, and drops everything after the separator. separate(table3, rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, NA), sep = &quot;/&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year cases ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 ## 5 China 1999 212258 ## 6 China 2000 213766 Your turn Separate the column rate in table3 to keep only the values after the separator in a column called population. Drop the values in front of the separator. Retain the column rate as well. Solution separate(table3, rate, into = c(NA, &quot;population&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, remove = FALSE) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year rate population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258/1272915272 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766/1280428583 1280428583 5.4.2.3 Separating by position It is also possible to separate by position. sep = 2 would split the column between the second and third character/ number etc. Let’s try that the separation by position. We will keep 4 letters from each country name rather than the whole word, and drop the rest. separate(table3, country, into = c(&quot;country&quot;, NA), sep = 4) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afgh 1999 745/19987071 ## 2 Afgh 2000 2666/20595360 ## 3 Braz 1999 37737/172006362 ## 4 Braz 2000 80488/174504898 ## 5 Chin 1999 212258/1272915272 ## 6 Chin 2000 213766/1280428583 5.4.2.4 Separating into more than 2 columns Special case. Let’s modify table3 a little bit by adding a new column with a value of 200 and unite that column with column rate. table3_mod &lt;- table3 %&gt;% mutate(new = 200) %&gt;% unite(rate, rate, new, sep = &quot;/&quot;) Now column rate has 3 sets of numbers, separated by two /. If we define we want to split the data into 2 columns, the first 2 sets of numbers are kept, and the third one is dropped with a warning. The code is still executed but the warning indicates that it might not have gone as planned. Hence, it is always good to check that the data object in the Global Environment looks exactly as what you have intended. separate(table3_mod, rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;) ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 6 rows [1, 2, 3, ## 4, 5, 6]. ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 If we are separating the columns and wanted to keep all sets of numbers, one in each column, we would use an into argument that includes 3 new columns. separate(table3_mod, rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;, &quot;200&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## country year cases population `200` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 200 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 200 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 200 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 200 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 200 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 200 Technically, you would not need a separator argument in the case above, as separate() splits the data whenever it detects a non-alphanumeric character (i.e. a character that isn’t a number or letter). Saying that, the separator argument is needed when your column contains non-alphanumeric characters as part of your cell values. If the values in population and 200 (separated by a /) were some sort of ID_code, AND we wanted to split the data into 2 columns, after the first / only, we would have to include an extra argument, and set it to \"merge\". separate(table3_mod, rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;ID_code&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, extra = &quot;merge&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases ID_code ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071/200 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360/200 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362/200 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898/200 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272/200 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583/200 There is still a tiny bit off in the tb_cases. Can you spot what it is? * Hint: Think about if you wanted to sum up all the TB cases occurred in the 3 countries within the years 1999, and 2000. Solution The new columns ID_code and cases are character columns. Whilst this is fine for ID_code, it is less beneficial for cases. If we wanted to sum up the cases column, values would need to be numerical. We could use the converting function as.integer(). table3_mod %&gt;% separate(rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;ID_code&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, extra = &quot;merge&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(cases = as.integer(cases)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases ID_code ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071/200 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360/200 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362/200 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898/200 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272/200 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583/200 5.4.2.5 Converting data types The slightly quicker and perhaps more elegant solution would be to add another argument convert to separate() and set it to TRUE. This will convert cases to integer and leave ID_code as character due to the non-numerical /. table3_mod %&gt;% separate(rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;ID_code&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, extra = &quot;merge&quot;, convert = TRUE) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases ID_code ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071/200 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360/200 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362/200 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898/200 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272/200 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583/200 5.4.3 unite() Take a look at table5. table5 ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country century year rate ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 19 99 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 20 00 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 19 99 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 20 00 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 19 99 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 20 00 213766/1280428583 Here the values in column year are split into century and year which is not very useful. Best to merge the 2 columns together as shown in the image below. unite() (the inverse of separate) can help to combine the values of century and year into a single column. It is used less frequently than it’s counterpart, but is still a useful function to know. The function unite() is structured like this: We would need the data table5, a new column we want to create year, the two columns we would like to combine (century and year), and define the separator as “nothing” since the default is sep = \"_\". unite(table5, year, century, year, sep = &quot;&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766/1280428583 Yay! The data of table5 is in a tidier format now - at least for column year. Ah, but we didn’t save the changes as an object in our Global Environment. Your turn Let’s combine the two steps of tidying table5 in a single pipe %&gt;% - separate the rate column into cases and population, and unite the columns year and century into a new column year. Store the new object as tb_cases in the Global Environment. Make sure, the columns cases and population are integer values. Solution tb_cases &lt;- table5 %&gt;% separate(rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, convert = TRUE) %&gt;% unite(year, century, year, sep = &quot;&quot;) tb_cases ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 The year column is still a character column. In this case, it does not matter too much, as 1999 and 2000 are levels of the column year and very unlikely to be involved in any calculations. In case we are dealing with actual numerical value and have the need to convert the data type, we need to use the function as.integer() as unite does not have a convert argument available. tb_cases_converted &lt;- tb_cases %&gt;% mutate(year = as.integer(year)) tb_cases_converted ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 5.4.4 additional arguments for unite() 5.4.4.1 Retaining the original column Similarly to separate(), unite also comes with a remove statement, so if you wanted to keep the original columns before merging them together, you would code unite(table5, year_combined, century, year, sep = &quot;&quot;, remove = FALSE) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## country year_combined century year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 19 99 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 20 00 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 19 99 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 20 00 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 1999 19 99 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 20 00 213766/1280428583 5.4.4.2 Removing missing values before uniting columns unite() also comes with an na.rm statement that will remove missing values prior to uniting the values of a column (actually, the values have to be a “character” column). Let me modify table5 a wee bit to make that point. table5_mod &lt;- table5 %&gt;% mutate(new = rep(c(&quot;200&quot;, NA), 3)) table5_mod ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## country century year rate new ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 19 99 745/19987071 200 ## 2 Afghanistan 20 00 2666/20595360 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 Brazil 19 99 37737/172006362 200 ## 4 Brazil 20 00 80488/174504898 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 China 19 99 212258/1272915272 200 ## 6 China 20 00 213766/1280428583 &lt;NA&gt; If we wanted to combine the values of rate and new, we would code unite(table5_mod, rate, rate, new, sep = &quot;/&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country century year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 19 99 745/19987071/200 ## 2 Afghanistan 20 00 2666/20595360/NA ## 3 Brazil 19 99 37737/172006362/200 ## 4 Brazil 20 00 80488/174504898/NA ## 5 China 19 99 212258/1272915272/200 ## 6 China 20 00 213766/1280428583/NA See how R adds the missing values onto rate, which we do not want. To avoid that happening, we can use the na.rm statement which removes missing values in columns of data type character before merging the columns. unite(table5_mod, rate, rate, new, sep = &quot;/&quot;, na.rm = TRUE) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country century year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 19 99 745/19987071/200 ## 2 Afghanistan 20 00 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 19 99 37737/172006362/200 ## 4 Brazil 20 00 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 19 99 212258/1272915272/200 ## 6 China 20 00 213766/1280428583 5.5 Bonus materials: mutate row names from the mtcars Remember, in lecture 2 when we were talking about the mtcars dataset and how the car types were not in listed as a separate column but rather row names?

Now, that we have learnt about the mutate() function, we can attempt to get all of these row names into a new column. All we have to do is combining a function called rownames() with mutate(). We also could use some more of these handy pipes %&gt;% you learnt about last week. df_mtcars &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% mutate(Car_type = rownames(mtcars)) In this example, we have taken the dataset mtcars, then added a new column called Car_type with mutate(). The column Car_type should then hold all the values that were previously listed as the row names in the original mtcars data. head(df_mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb Car_type ## 1 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 ## 2 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 Wag ## 3 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Datsun 710 ## 4 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Hornet 4 Drive ## 5 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 Hornet Sportabout ## 6 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Valiant We can now look at the data df_mtcars, and see that the new column was added at the end of the dataset.

By the end of today, you will know How to rename column headers How to recode cell values based on conditions How to obtain unique values from your data This lesson is led by Gaby Mahrholz. 6.1 Pre-steps Before we can start to focus on some other functions that might come in handy for data manipulation, we need to make sure to load tidyverse into the library. library(tidyverse) 6.2 rename() rename() is a very useful function if we wanted to change column names. All available column are retained, so nothing is lost. If you had 5 variables in a tibble, and wanted to change the name of one of them, your output would be 5 columns in total - one column with a changed name and 4 columns with the previous names. The rename() function follows a very simple pattern of rename(data, new_column_name = old_column_name) You can rename multiple column headers by including more arguments, separating them with a comma. Let’s take a look at a simple example in table1. table1 ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 If we wanted to change the column headers of country to Country and population to Population, and keep the columns year and cases as they are, we would code rename(table1, Country = country, Population = population) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## Country year cases Population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 If you want to select a few columns and rename them in the process, you could use select(). The structure is the same as with rename(), the only difference is that the new data only retains the columns mentioned explicitly within select(). select(data, new_column_name = old_column_name) Modifying the rename() example from above would lead to selecting only the columns country and population from table1 and renaming them as Country and Population at the same time. select(table1, Country = country, Population = population) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## Country Population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 174504898 ## 5 China 1272915272 ## 6 China 1280428583 6.3 Conditional statements Conditional statements are used when you want to create an output value that is conditioned on an evaluation. Here, we are showing you how to use them in combination with mutate() by either modifying the values within one column, or by adding a new column. Example scenario: Imagine that we have data in which a column Sex holds values of 1 and 2 that stand for Male, and Female participants respectively. Conditional statements make an evaluation: if Sex is 1, then put the value of Male in a new column called Sex_char; if Sex is 2 put Female in column Sex_char. Let’s create some fake data for this. 40 participants (17 male, 20 female, 3 other), they are between 16 and 40 years of age, they study at 4 different institutions (University of Glasgow, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow Caledonian University, University of the West of Scotland), and we had them complete an R assignment and recorded their grade points. set.seed(999) #so we all get the same random data fake_data &lt;- tibble(PP_ID = 1:40, Sex = c(rep(1,17), rep(2,20), rep(3,3)), Age = sample(16:40, 40, replace = TRUE), Institution = sample(c(rep(1,10), rep(2,8), rep(3,10), rep(4,10), rep(99,2))), Grade_points = sample(c(0,9:22), 40, replace = TRUE)) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 5 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30, 20, 2... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 13, 10,... kable(fake_data) PP_ID Sex Age Institution Grade_points 1 1 19 3 0 2 1 22 1 20 3 1 24 1 15 4 1 29 4 20 5 1 16 2 11 6 1 25 3 22 7 1 37 1 21 8 1 18 4 9 9 1 38 3 13 10 1 39 4 22 11 1 30 3 19 12 1 20 4 13 13 1 22 4 10 14 1 21 4 0 15 1 34 2 12 16 1 26 3 17 17 1 33 3 20 18 2 16 99 22 19 2 20 2 12 20 2 34 3 20 21 2 27 3 10 22 2 24 4 11 23 2 36 1 15 24 2 38 99 21 25 2 20 2 19 26 2 40 2 15 27 2 19 4 18 28 2 39 3 16 29 2 40 4 21 30 2 30 2 20 31 2 38 1 16 32 2 31 1 19 33 2 26 4 17 34 2 17 1 18 35 2 24 1 21 36 2 16 3 21 37 2 33 1 18 38 3 39 2 18 39 3 23 1 17 40 3 19 2 18 Now, the data doesn’t look very readable at the moment. If we pass this data set onto a fellow researcher, they would ask us how the columns Sex and Institution are coded. Best would be to adjust the values to make that clearer. There are the options of using the function recode(), an ifelse statement or case_when(). 6.3.1 recode() Can be used for character, numeric, and factors columns. The structure for recode() is: recode(variable_to_recode, old_value = new_value) This is a bit tricky to remember as it doesn’t follow the usual tidyverse logic. In select(), rename(), and mutate() for example it is the other way around new_thing = old_thing or new_thing = something_computational) In combination with mutate(), the structure looks as follows: mutate(data, new_column_name = recode(variable_to_recode, old_value = new_value)) What is a bit unusual in this structure is that we need a new column name within the mutate() function but also a reference column within recode() on which the conditional recoding is based upon. The new column name within mutate() can either be an entirely new column name, or if it is an existing column name that original column would be overwritten by the new values we recode. So, let’s turn to our fake_data, and apply that logic for recoding the values of the column Sex where 1 = “Male”, 2 = “Female”, and 3 = “Other”. We will add a new column Sex_char onto our fake_data. The only tricky thing to remember here is that recoding numeric values requires backticks (if the numbers are on the left side of the equation). fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Sex_char = recode(Sex, `1` = &quot;Male&quot;, `2` = &quot;Female&quot;, `3` = &quot;Other&quot;)) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 6 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30, 20, 2... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 13, 10,... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;... If you forget to recode one condition (for example `3` = “Other”), values for 3 would be displayed as NA in the new column. This becomes more important when you decide to overwrite an existing column. Your turn The next variable to recode is Institution: 1 = UoG, 2 = Strathclyde, 3 = GCU, 4 = UWS In the questionnaire, two participants forgot to indicate which university they are studying at (coded as 99), but fortunately we know that they are at the University of Strathclyde (the test was distributed to 10 students at each institution, however, Strathclyde only has 8 responses). Add a new column Institution_char to fake_data that holds the recoded values as Solution fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Institution_char = recode(Institution, `1` = &quot;UoG&quot;, `2` = &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, `3` = &quot;GCU&quot;, `4` = &quot;UWS&quot;, `99` = &quot;Strathclyde&quot;)) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 7 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30, 2... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, ... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 13,... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, &quot;G... An alternative to recode() is ifelse(). Let’s see how Sex and Institution could have been recoded using ifelse(). 6.3.2 ifelse() ifelse() is a good option when dealing with character or numeric input but struggles with dates and factors. None of the columns in fake_data are dates or factors, so we can easily use ifelse() for recoding variables. The generic structure for ifelse() is: ifelse(test, yes, no) test: is an expression to test that creates an output of TRUE or FALSE yes: if test has a TRUE outcome, this is what would be coded in the new column no: if test has a FALSE outcome, this is what would be coded in the new column The interpretation of ifelse() is: if the test expression is TRUE, write the value of yes, otherwise no. In combination with mutate(), the structure looks as follows: mutate(data, new_column_name = ifelse(test, yes, no)) How would we apply that to recoding Sex? We would want the expression to test whether the Sex column holds a value of 1, then a new column should code it as “Male”, otherwise as “Female”. Let’s add a new column Sex_ifelse to fake_data fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Sex_ifelse = ifelse(Sex == 1, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;)) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 8 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30, 2... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, ... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 13,... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, &quot;G... ## $ Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male... AHHHH!!! But what about the 3 participants that chose option 3? They are now coded as “Female”. Hmmm. One way to get around that would be a nested ifelse() statement. Instead of replacing the no argument (FALSE evaluation) with “Female”, we could include a second ifelse() statement. fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Sex_ifelse = ifelse(Sex == 1, &quot;Male&quot;, ifelse(Sex == 2, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;))) Now everything is coded as it should be. Your turn Recode Institution using ifelse(). Add a new column Institution_ifelse to fake_data. A quick reminder of the Institution values: 1 = “UoG”, 2 and 99 = “Strathclyde”, 3 = “GCU”, and 4 = “UWS” Solution fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Institution_ifelse = ifelse(Institution == 1, &quot;UoG&quot;, ifelse(Institution == 3, &quot;GCU&quot;, ifelse(Institution == 4, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;)))) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 9 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30,... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 1... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Ma... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, ... ## $ Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Ma... ## $ Institution_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, ... It does look a bit convoluted, and there is definitely the need to count opening and closing brackets, but it gets us the output we wanted. Before showing you how this can be coded in a slightly neater way with case_when(), I’d like to highlight one advantage ifelse() has over recode(), namely that the test expression can evaluate more complex “things” as long as they return a logical value. For example, if we wanted to add a column Pass_Fail to fake_data, that holds values of “Pass” for grade points above 9, and “Fail” for values of 9 and below, we would code fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Pass_Fail = ifelse(Grade_points &gt; 9, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Fail&quot;)) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 10 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30,... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 1... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Ma... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, ... ## $ Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Ma... ## $ Institution_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, ... ## $ Pass_Fail &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Fail&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pa... We could also add a column Grade to fake_data that tells us the primary band the students got in their test. Grade_points between 18 and 22 result in A, 15 to 17 = B, 12 to 14 = C, 9 to 11 = D, 6 to 8 = E, 3 to 5 = F, 1 and 2 = G, and 0 = H. Here we can use the %in% operator. fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Grade = ifelse(Grade_points %in% 18:22, &quot;A&quot;, ifelse(Grade_points %in% 15:17, &quot;B&quot;, ifelse(Grade_points %in% 12:14, &quot;C&quot;, ifelse(Grade_points %in% 9:11, &quot;D&quot;, ifelse(Grade_points %in% 6:8, &quot;E&quot;, ifelse(Grade_points %in% 3:5, &quot;F&quot;, ifelse(Grade_points %in% 1:2, &quot;G&quot;,&quot;H&quot;)))))))) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 11 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, 30,... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19, 1... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Ma... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, ... ## $ Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Ma... ## $ Institution_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde&quot;, ... ## $ Pass_Fail &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Fail&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pa... ## $ Grade &lt;chr&gt; &quot;H&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;C&quot;... 6.3.3 case_when() case_when() vectorises multiple ifelse() statements, and might potentially be a touch easier to digest visually than ifelse(). There are few guidelines to follow when using case_when(): A sequence of two-sided formulas is needed. The left hand side (LHS) determines which values match this case. The right hand side (RHS) provides the replacement value. The LHS must evaluate to a logical vector. The RHS does not need to be logical, but all RHSs must evaluate to the same type of vector. Let’s apply this to recoding the values in the column Institution. Combining case_when() with mutate(), we will add another column called Institution_case_when to fake_data. fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Institution_case_when = case_when( Institution == 1 ~ &quot;UoG&quot;, Institution == 3 ~ &quot;GCU&quot;, Institution == 4 ~ &quot;UWS&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Strathclyde&quot; ) ) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 12 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, ... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde... ## $ Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Institution_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde... ## $ Pass_Fail &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Fail&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, ... ## $ Grade &lt;chr&gt; &quot;H&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, ... ## $ Institution_case_when &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde... The TRUE statement at the end is similar to the the “else” in the ifelse() function. A further similarity between the two is that arguments are evaluated in order, so you must proceed from the most specific to the most general. Your turn Add a column Grade_case_when into fake_data using a combination of mutate() and case_when(), that recodes grade points to primary bands. Quick reminder: grade points 18 - 22 = A, 15 to 17 = B, 12 to 14 = C, 9 to 11 = D, 6 to 8 = E, 3 to 5 = F, 1 and 2 = G, and 0 = H. Solution fake_data &lt;- mutate(fake_data, Grade_case_when = case_when( Grade_points %in% 18:22 ~ &quot;A&quot;, Grade_points %in% 15:17 ~ &quot;B&quot;, Grade_points %in% 12:14 ~ &quot;C&quot;, Grade_points %in% 9:11 ~ &quot;D&quot;, Grade_points %in% 6:8 ~ &quot;E&quot;, Grade_points %in% 3:5 ~ &quot;F&quot;, Grade_points %in% 1:2 ~ &quot;G&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;H&quot; ) ) glimpse(fake_data) ## Observations: 40 ## Variables: 13 ## $ PP_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1... ## $ Sex &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 19, 22, 24, 29, 16, 25, 37, 18, 38, 39, ... ## $ Institution &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4... ## $ Grade_points &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 20, 15, 20, 11, 22, 21, 9, 13, 22, 19... ## $ Sex_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Institution_char &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde... ## $ Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, ... ## $ Institution_ifelse &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde... ## $ Pass_Fail &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Fail&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Pass&quot;, ... ## $ Grade &lt;chr&gt; &quot;H&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, ... ## $ Institution_case_when &lt;chr&gt; &quot;GCU&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UoG&quot;, &quot;UWS&quot;, &quot;Strathclyde... ## $ Grade_case_when &lt;chr&gt; &quot;H&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, ... 6.4 distinct() The distinct() function is used to remove duplicate rows in your dataframe. If we are using distinct() without specifying any arguments, R checks the whole row and excludes any row that is exactly repeated. fake_data_no_dup &lt;- fake_data %&gt;% distinct() We can see that all rows are still there. This is not surprising, given every participant has a unique ID number. However, distinct() does take arguments as well, namely the variable columns you are trying to determine uniqueness for. Say we we wanted to see how many different institutions we have data from. institution_distinct &lt;- fake_data %&gt;% distinct(Institution_char) institution_distinct ## # A tibble: 4 x 1 ## Institution_char ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 GCU ## 2 UoG ## 3 UWS ## 4 Strathclyde We can see that there are 4 distinct institutions. But what happened to the output? We still have the output from the column we specified but all other information is gone. One quick solution would be to use the argument .keep_all and set that to TRUE (the default here is FALSE). institution_distinct &lt;- fake_data %&gt;% distinct(Institution_char, .keep_all = TRUE) institution_distinct ## # A tibble: 4 x 13 ## PP_ID Sex Age Institution Grade_points Sex_char Institution_char ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 1 19 3 0 Male GCU ## 2 2 1 22 1 20 Male UoG ## 3 4 1 29 4 20 Male UWS ## 4 5 1 16 2 11 Male Strathclyde ## # ... with 6 more variables: Sex_ifelse &lt;chr&gt;, Institution_ifelse &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Pass_Fail &lt;chr&gt;, Grade &lt;chr&gt;, Institution_case_when &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Grade_case_when &lt;chr&gt; In the new institution_distinct dataframe, we still have 4 institutions listed but we kept all 13 columns. If there are multiple rows with the same input (in this case 40 participants from 4 different institutions), distinct() only preserves the first row a new value occurs. The distinct() function also allows you to eliminate duplicate rows with multiple variables in the dataframe. So if we wanted to see where participants were studying but also the different sexes taking part in the study, we would code… institution_sex_distinct &lt;- fake_data %&gt;% distinct(Institution_char, Sex_char) institution_sex_distinct ## # A tibble: 10 x 2 ## Institution_char Sex_char ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 GCU Male ## 2 UoG Male ## 3 UWS Male ## 4 Strathclyde Male ## 5 Strathclyde Female ## 6 GCU Female ## 7 UWS Female ## 8 UoG Female ## 9 Strathclyde Other ## 10 UoG Other institution_sex_distinct has 10 observations, so that means, we have at least 1 male and 1 female participant from each of the 4 institutions. Additionally, Strathclyde and Glasgow have participants classifying as neither male nor female (here coded as “Other”). You can see they are not sorted by either of the column. Why is that? Solution The values are sorted by occurrence. R goes through the tibble row by row to determine whether the values are distinct from the ones in the row before. So if you look at your original dataframe fake_data, you can see the first row is a male participant from Glasgow Caledonian University. The participant in row 2 is from the University of Glasgow, but so is participant 3 (which means he is not listed in the distinct tibble). The next unique value would be detected in row 4, then in row 7, then in row 18, 20, 22, 23, 38, and 39. 6.5 Recap Let’s just have some fun with fake_data whilst recapping a little bit of what we did in the past 5 weeks. 6.5.1 Question 1 Select the variables PP_ID, Sex_char, Age, Institution_char, Grade_points, Grade, and Pass_Fail from fake_dataand save it as fake_data in your Global Environment (i.e. overwrite/replace fake_data).

They are asking for a table with 4 columns in which the first column titled Institution lists the university, the second column is called Males for the average grade point scores of the males at each institution, the third column called Females with average grade point scores for the females, and the fourth column Better should say \"female\" or \"male\" if the females or males had higher grade points respectively. Store the output in your Global Environment as a new object called fake_data_sex.

Load tidyverse into the library and read the data into our Global Environment as migration_scot. library(tidyverse) migration_scot &lt;- read_csv(&quot;free_movement_uk.csv&quot;) #downloaded from the Scottish Government Stats website 7.2 Introduction to the data This data is openly available from the Scottish Government, and it introduces the flow of people at different ages and sex into and out of the Scotland from the rest of UK (RUK) and Overseas. We have several variables to work with: Variable Description FeatureCode Codes given by the Scottish Government DateCode Year of data collected Measurement What type of measurement it is (here we have only counts i.e. the number of people) Units Units (here we have number of people) Value The actual count (i.e. the number of people) Age Age of the counted people (separate by age, and total (sum of all age groups)) Sex Sex of the counted people (separate by sex, and total (sum all sex groups)) Migration Source Where the people are coming from (Overseas, RUK) Migration Type Whether people are coming or leaving (In, Out, and Net (people coming in less the people leaving)) The data is a bit messy, so let’s clean it a little bit before we can work with it. When we make plots, we want to make sure that the data we are working with contains only data that we are going to include in the plot. This helps us avoid things like double counting. For example, if we have values for males and females and total, but we do not want to give separate representations for males and females, then we would only keep information that gives us the total number. 7.3 Some warm-up tasks Use pipes %&gt;% for the following 4 tasks and save your data into the trafic_scot variable so that it appears in your Global Environment. Select only the necessary variable - DateCode, Value, Sex, Age, Migration Source &amp; Migration Type (notice that some variable names include spaces) Filter the data in column DateCode, and keep only observations from 2016 Keep only the total number of people by Age (‘All’) and Sex (‘All’) Keep only the information about the number of people that came into and left Scotland (we do not want to know about the net value) traffic_scot &lt;- migration_scot %&gt;% select(DateCode, Value, Sex, Age, `Migration Source`, `Migration Type`) %&gt;% filter(DateCode == &#39;2016&#39;, Age == &#39;All&#39;, Sex != &#39;All&#39;, `Migration Type` != &#39;Net&#39;) 7.4 The package GGPLOT2 We use the ggplot2 package due to its ease of layering and variety. The ggplot2 package allows us to create beautiful and various plots that can show us much more than just the simplicity of the base R plots. 7.5 Layering Plots created with ggplot work by using layers. In the simplest form we have two layers. Layer 1: what data are we going to use Layer 2: how do we want it to look Layer 1: ggplot(data, aes(x, y, …)) + Layer 2: geom_something(…) 7.5.1 Layer 1 Plots always start with ggplot(). This initialises the plot. It is used to tell R what data we are going to use. We can also set the aesthetics of the plot which will be used to specify the axes we are going to use, any groupings, variables we are going to colour based on, etc. Unless specifically overwritten in the following layers, all the data information you give in this first layer will be inherited in everything else you do. For now we are going to stick with one global specification - i.e. we are going to specify all our data in this first layer. If you run just the first command, R is going to show you the first layer - i.e. a blank screen. Let’s try it quickly. ggplot() Now let’s add some information. Let’s include the data and the axes. From our data traffic_scot let’s put Sex on the x axis and Value on the y axis. This way we can visualise how many people from each sex category came to and left Scotland overall. What’s the difference? ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value)) What is the difference in the produced plots from the above two lines of code? What does the first layer give you? 7.5.2 Layer 2 and onward From the second layer onward, we are specifying how we want our plot to look: from the type of graph to the titles and colours. For now, we are going to stick with the basics. 7.6 How do we choose the type of plot? There are numerous plots we can choose from, and we are going to try several today. Before plotting we need to know what types of data we want to portray. Depending on whether our data is categorical or continuous, the type of plot that is most appropriate will change. 7.6.1 Types of data 7.6.1.1 Continuous Continuous data has no bounds and the distance between any two consecutive points is equivalent to the distance between any other two consecutive points - i.e. the difference between 1 and 2 is the same as the difference between 3 and 4, or 5 and 6 etc. 7.6.1.2 Categorical Categorical data, simply put, groups data. The data in each group or category vary solely on one characteristic and usually those characteristics cannot be ranked - i.e. sex, race, nationality etc. 7.6.2 Number of variables Next we need to know the relationship between how many variables we want to show. In a 2D plot, we can usually graphically show between 1 and 3 variables with ease. After that, more than 2 dimensions are necessary. See the five plots below. What type of data are used (categorical or continuous, or both? How many variables do we need to create these plots? Solution 2 variables: 1 continuous, 1 categorical Solution 3 variables: 2 categorical, 1 continuous Solution 2 variables: 1 categorical, 1 continuous Solution 2 variables: 2 continuous Solution 3 variables: 2 continuous, 1 categorical Tip: Most of the time, if you cannot represent a graph in 2D then you are probably trying to show too much, and you should reconsider splitting the graphs Let’s get back to our free movement data that we started with in the section above. What types of data are we trying to plot according to our first layer? Continuous, categorical, or both? Solution We are using both continuous (value or count of people) and categorical (sex). How many variables have we chosen so far? Type the number in the box below. Let’s create a column/bar plot to visualise the data using geom_col(). What does the data look like? ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value)) + geom_col() Considering what we know from the data description and the different variable in it, do we need another variable to make the plot more informative? If yes, which one? Explanation If you worked in the immigration office, you would want to know how many people left and how many people came to Scotland. Knowing how many people moved about is not particularly informative. In what ways can we differentiate the males and females who came to and who went out of Scotland? Separating the data by Migration Type would tell us whether the people came into or left Scotland. 7.6.3 Groupings When we want to group data to provide a better representation, we can usually use colour, shapes etc. Most of the time this will depend on the type of graph we want to use. If we are using line graphs, then colours are usually best. If we are using dot plots then we can use the shape as well as the colours to differentiate the different groups. Let’s first look at colour. Depending on the type of graph, colouring in can be done either with colour or with fill. For our column plots we use fill. If we used colour, then we would get different colours for the outlines. You can find out whether to use colour or fill by typing the name of the geom in the Help search bar or typing ?geom_col() in the console and looking at the Aesthetics section. ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_col(position = &#39;dodge&#39;) Let’s decompose the code above: We have our data and our two variables. They are the same as before. This time we are saying that we want the data to be separated even further by Migration Type and we have given two different colours to the ‘In’ and ‘Out’ migration types using the additional argument fill. We have also added the argument position = 'dodge' in the geom_col(). This makes sure that any groupings we create and create new columns are then presented separately. Simple task: Remove position =‘dodge’ from the geom and describe what happens in your stub file. ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_col() Simple task: Use position = ‘fill’ and describe what happens in your stub. # create your plot here ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_col(position = &#39;fill&#39;) Explanation If we use position = ‘fill’ it stacks our data and it also gives us proportions: check the y-axis between the plot with position = ‘fill’ and the one without any position arguments. Whereas the plot without the position argument just stacks information on top of one another, position = ‘fill’ shows relative proportions. Use the Help menu or put ? in the console in front of the function you want to know more about, for example ?geom_col(). The argument position is an argument specific for the geom_col. It is just one example of an additional argument that helps us to represent the data better. These types of arguments allow for better control over the plots that we create. To find what arguments each geom has, look for it in the Help section or put ? in the Console in front of the function. Geoms in ggplot2 have a large selection of arguments to allow you to adjust your visualisations. This is what makes it one of the most preferred visualisation packages by the R community. 7.6.3.1 More groupings Now let’s imagine that we want to know whether the individuals are moving to/from Overseas or RUK as well as all the information we have so far. Should we create more groups? Let’s try. ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`, colour =`Migration Source`)) + geom_col(position = &#39;dodge&#39;) Here I have used the argument colour to give different borders to the migration sources. As you can see, this makes it much more difficult to see. Next week, we will work on separating the plots. Would you think there is a better way to represent the data? Write it down in your stub file. 7.7 Now let’s have a look at different plots with more complexity Imagine you want to see the difference in the number of people coming into and moving out of Scotland from both the RUK and Overseas throughout the years, but you do not want to know the net flow of people, their age or their sex. What variables would you use? Write them down in your stub file. Solution DateCode, Migration Type, Migration Source, Value First, let’s get the data we will need. We want our selected variables from above, and the overall data for the rest of the variables i.e. the ‘all’ categories for Age, and Sex. Remember we want to look at people moving in and out, so we do not want the net Migration Type. Save the output into the variable trafic_scot2 so that it appears in your Global Environment. traffic_scot2 &lt;- migration_scot %&gt;% filter(Age == &#39;All&#39;, `Migration Type` != &#39;Net&#39;, Sex == &#39;All&#39;) %&gt;% select(DateCode, Value,`Migration Source`, `Migration Type`) What type of data are these variables? DateCode: continuous categorical Value: continuous categorical Sex: continuous categorical Migration Source: continuous categorical Migration Type: continuous categorical So we need to use a different type of plot - one that can portray continuous data well enough. Good way to portray data like this are point graphs (i.e. scatter plots) and line graphs. We have several variables again. It will help if we separate them with different aesthetics. ggplot(traffic_scot2, aes(DateCode, Value, shape = `Migration Source`, colour = `Migration Type`)) + geom_point() This seems difficult to look at. Let’s make it easier by adding a line that connects the data. We can do this by adding another Layer. ggplot(traffic_scot2, aes(DateCode, Value, shape = `Migration Source`, colour = `Migration Type`)) + geom_point() + geom_line() Question: How do we know that the line graph is going to connect the Migration Type and not the Migration Source? Solution If we look up geom_point and geom_line we can see the type of aesthetics that they take. Look them up in the Help tab or by typing ?geom_point() in the console. There you will find a section called aesthetics, which will tell you the aesthetics each of them can have. Because lines cannot use an aesthetic of shape, it will only inherit the colour aesthetic from ggplot(). Scatter and dot plots are excellent representations of the data as they show us where each data point is. In this way no data can hide behind a bar chart. 7.8 Other plots Let’s make some more plots. Violin plots and Box plots We need a continuous variable and a categorical variable for both of them. In both of these the categorical variable usually goes on the x-axis and the continuous on the y axis. Let’s get back to the original data and plot the distribution of all females entering and leaving Scotland from overseas, from all ages. For this, we need to tidy the data into what we need and store it into the variable female_migration female_migration &lt;- migration_scot %&gt;% filter(Sex == &#39;Female&#39;, `Migration Source` == &#39;To-from Overseas&#39;, Age == &#39;All&#39;, `Migration Type` != &#39;Net&#39;) # make box plots ggplot(female_migration, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() #make violin plots ggplot(female_migration, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin() These plots show us the distribution of females entering and leaving Scotland. What we can tell that over the yearsis that we haven’t had less than 12000 women coming to Scotland and no more than 16000 women leaving. These types of plots also tell us where the bulk of the data is. We can see from the violin plots that the most common number of females coming into Scotland throughout the years is between 22000 and 18000. Boxplots on the other hand, tell you where the middle 50% of the data are. Your turn Using the data for this class follow the instructions. Remember, you can use View() in the console to look at your data, or click on the data variable in your Global Environment. This can help you to make your choices for the steps bellow and with the exact spelling. Start from the original dataset we loaded in the beginning traffic_scot. Use pipes %&gt;% for the first 5 steps and save the output into a variable my_data. Use that data to create three separate plots for steps 6, 7 and 8. Select two different years. Select two different age groups. Select the total for both sex ( i.e. ‘all’). Select migration In and Out of Scotland. Pick whether you are going to look at To-from Rest of UK or To-from Overseas. Plot the overall people, regardless of age and year, that have moved into and left Scotland using geom_col(). Save the plot in the variable q6 into your Global Environment.

Learn to work with legends. This lesson is led by Greta Todorova. 8.1 Pre-steps Today, we will be working with ggplot2 which is part of tidyverse and data from the Scottish Government saved in the file free_movement_uk.csv. Load tidyverse into the library, and read the data into our Global Environment as migration_scot. library(tidyverse) migration_scot &lt;- read_csv(&quot;free_movement_uk.csv&quot;) 8.2 Re-introduction to the data This data is openly available from the Scottish Government, and it introduces the flow of people at different ages and sex into and out of Scotland from the rest of UK (RUK) and Overseas. We have several variables to work with: Variable Description FeatureCode Codes given by the Scottish Government DateCode Year of data collected Measurement What type of measurement it is (here we have only counts i.e. the number of people) Units Units (here we have number of people) Value The actual count (i.e. the number of people) Age Age of the counted people (separate by age, and total (sum of all age groups)) Sex Sex of the counted people (separate by sex, and total (sum all sex groups)) Migration Source Where the people are coming from (Overseas, RUK) Migration Type Whether people are coming or leaving (In, Out, and Net (people coming in less the people leaving)) This is the wrangled data from last week. traffic_scot &lt;- migration_scot %&gt;% select(DateCode, Value, Sex, `Migration Source`, `Migration Type`, Age) %&gt;% filter(DateCode == &#39;2016&#39;, Age == &#39;All&#39;, Sex != &#39;All&#39;, `Migration Type` != &#39;Net&#39;) 8.3 Create multiple plots in one Sometimes, we have way too many variables and they are all important. You should always avoid having busy plots. They get too confusing, and it is easy for people to misinterpret them. We are going to look at two ways to create multiple plots. 8.3.1 Select the data beforehand and create different plots. Simple Task 1: From the data we just created, select only data relevant for movement to and from the rest of the UK and save it to the Global Environment as an object called rest_of_uk . rest_of_uk &lt;- NULL Solution rest_of_uk &lt;- traffic_scot %&gt;% filter(`Migration Source` == &#39;To-from Rest of UK&#39;) Simple Task 2: Create a column plot that shows the number of people for each sex using the data we just created using geom_col(). Separate the data by using different colours based on Migration Type. Don’t forget to use position = ‘dodge’ so that your columns do not overlap. ggplot(NULL) + NULL Solution ggplot(rest_of_uk, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_col(position = &#39;dodge&#39;) Simple Task 3: Now plot only the data for the movement to and from Overseas following the previous two steps. This time, make sure you save your wrangled data into an object called overseas and then use it to create your plot. overseas &lt;- NULL ggplot(NULL) + NULL Solution overseas&lt;- traffic_scot %&gt;% filter(`Migration Source` == &#39;To-from Overseas&#39;) ggplot(overseas, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_col(position = &#39;dodge&#39;) This becomes very cumbersome when we have more than one variable. Imagine you have data for 10 different countries. Can you imagine doing these plots by hand. Moreover, when you have to arrange them on a page to show how things differ you will loose a lot of time. Instead we can use facets. 8.3.2 Facets Facets allow us to create separate plots without manually separating the data. Moreover we can specify how we want to put the plots in a grid: do we want them side by side or one on top of each other, etc. We can use several facet functions. facet_grid(variable_to_split_by) structures the rows and columns of graphs based on a third variable facet_grid(.~variable) creates columns - i.e. side by side panels facet_grid(variable~.) creates rows - i.e. one on top of the other facet_grid(variable1~variable2) creates rows based on variable1 and columns based on variable2 facet_wrap(variable) creates a grid with rectangular slots for the plots based on your variables Let’s replicate the two plots we just created but using facet_grid() and put them side-by-side in one. Now we have both plots next to each other, which makes it much easier to look at the differences in the migration patterns between the two Migration Sources. ggplot(traffic_scot, aes(x = Sex, y = Value, fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_col(position = &#39;dodge&#39;) + facet_grid(.~`Migration Source`) Question Time Let’s look at these plots. Which sex tends to move to Scotland more, regardless of migration location? Female Male Which migration location do both males and females migrate to more when they leave Scotland? To Overseas To RUK 8.4 Global and Local aesthetics So far, we have been working with a Global definition of the aesthetics. This allows us to specify the axes and the groupings only once. Sometimes, we want to use multiple data and put multiple plots on top of each other. For these occasions we can specify the aesthetics at a local level - i.e. in the geoms. If you remember from last week, we specified both the colour and the shape in our ggplot() when we were making the line graph. The geom_line() inherited the colour but not the shape argument. However, if we have two geoms that share the same characteristics but we do not want to have the same colours, we can move them to each of the geoms instead of specifying them in ggplot(). Let’s redo the violins and boxplots from last week, and put them together into two separate layers of the same graph. This time, we will give them some colour. We will colour the violins with the fill argument and make the boxplots transparent using the alpha argument. boxes &lt;- migration_scot %&gt;% filter(Sex == &#39;Female&#39;, `Migration Source` == &#39;To-from Overseas&#39;, Age == &#39;All&#39;, `Migration Type` != &#39;Net&#39;) #make violins and boxplots ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5)) Because alpha (the transparency argument) and fill are arguments for both box plots and violins, if we had put them in the ggplot() layer, they would both be inherited by the two geoms. 8.5 Themes: Making your plots pretty: looking the way you want them to The great thing about making your own plots in R is that you can make it look the way you want it to look. Even better, if you are writing a paper, graphs are easy to adjust to match journals’ criteria. Let’s adjust the look of our graph. 8.5.1 Ready-made themes ggplot2 comes with several ready made themes. Some of them are: theme_bw(): a white background with major axes and border. theme_minimal(): a white background with major axes and more. Just use the cheetsheet for visualisations with ggplot for some more examples. Themes are just like any other layer for ggplot. You just add them at the end of your plot with +. Let’s add one of these theme formats to our plot above. ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5)) + theme_bw() 8.5.2 Adding axes titles and headings Next, let’s add some titles and better labels with labs(). You need to specify which labels you want to change - x, y or the title, and type in the labels you want. ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5)) + theme_bw()+ labs(title = &#39;Female migration to and from Overseas into Scotland&#39;, x = &#39;Migration direction&#39;, y = &#39;Number of people&#39;) Sometimes, we need the titles to be a specific size. We can change all of that in an additional theme() layer. We specify the argument we want to change and what we need to change. In our case, we want to change the size of the x axis title to 12pt, and the graph title to 20pt. Let’s also pretend we do not want the y axis title. We can also specify this in the theme() layer. We do this by specifying element_text() and element_blank() for the correct theme arguments (axis.title.x, title, axis.title.x). Simply, for that element of the plot, what do we want to change - text and to make it blank. ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5)) + theme_bw()+ labs(title = &#39;Female migration to and from\\nOverseas into Scotland&#39;, x = &#39;Migration direction&#39;, y = &#39;Number of people&#39;) + theme( axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), # read this as: change the size of element_text of the #title of the x axis title = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_blank() # read this as: change the title of the y axis to blank ) 8.6 Changing colours We can rely on the colour schemes automatically, or we can manually specify colours. To change any of the colours, we need to specify which scale we are changing. This is done by specifying the aesthetic. In our case, we are changing the colours of the fill aesthetic so we use scale_fill_manual(). Instead of using names, you can use any hex colour you want. A hex color is the representation of a color using a 6 digit code. scale_fill_manual() works like another layer, which overwrites the automatic colour schemes. Because it overwrites an existing function, it has to be after the geom that uses the fill argument. ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&#39;#127d69&#39;, &#39;#cedc00&#39;)) + #here I have picked two specific colours theme_bw() + labs(title = &#39;Female migration to and from\\nOverseas into Scotland&#39;, x = &#39;Migration direction&#39;, y = &#39;Number of people&#39;) + theme( axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_blank() ) 8.7 Legends We can see that for any additional aesthetic we have put, ggplot has created a legend on the side. Now let’s change what the labels actually say. We do this in the same place we specified the colours scale_fill_manual because again, we are overwriting the automatic fill labels. Let’s also: 1) hide the legend associated with the box plots; 2) move the legend to the bottom of the graph using the legend.position argument; and 3) change the size of the legend labels (using legend.title). We do step 3 in the theme() layer as well. Because we have more than one legend, everything we do will be applied to both legends. This is a good idea for consistency. But when we want to hide one of the legends, we have to specify that in the geom itself using the argument show.legend. ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5), show.legend = FALSE) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&#39;#127d69&#39;, &#39;#cedc00&#39;), labels = c(&#39;Coming to Scotland&#39;, &#39;Leaving Scotland&#39;)) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &#39;Female migration to and from\\nOverseas into Scotland&#39;, x = &#39;Migration direction&#39;, y = &#39;Number of people&#39;) + theme( axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_blank(), legend.position = &#39;bottom&#39;, #move the legend to the bottom legend.title = element_text(size = 10) ) 8.8 Changing axes ticks Now, we also need to change what is stated on our x axis to match the legend. We use scale_x_discrete() to give new names inside graph, so that we do not have to change our dataset. We specify the labels of the new groups by giving the old name in quotes and then the new name, also in quotes. We use scale_x_discrete(), because we have discrete groups - a categorical variable. ggplot(boxes, aes(x = `Migration Type`, y = Value)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = `Migration Type`)) + geom_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.5), show.legend = FALSE) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&#39;#127d69&#39;, &#39;#cedc00&#39;), labels = c(&#39;Coming to Scotland&#39;, &#39;Leaving Scotland&#39;)) + scale_x_discrete(labels = c(&#39;In&#39; = &#39;Coming to Scotland&#39;, &#39;Out&#39; = &#39;Leaving Scotland&#39;)) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &#39;Female migration to and from\\nOverseas into Scotland&#39;, x = &#39;Migration direction&#39;, y = &#39;Number of people&#39;) + theme( axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_blank(), legend.position = &#39;bottom&#39;, legend.title = element_text(size = 10) ) Let’s also say that we are plotting data which is continuous but we want to show each of the values. For example we have years and we want to show every year. ggplot will try and skip some of the years to make the graph look neater. There are several ways we can change that. We can either make the variable into a factor or a character using as.characterso that ggplot will be forced to look at it as a discrete variable or we can change the ticks of the x axis by giving them limits and breaks in the layer that overwrites the original x values - scale_x_continuous(). Let’s use the graph from last week which showed us the change in migration across the years. # First, we are getting the data from last week to recreate the code. traffic_scot2 &lt;- migration_scot %&gt;% filter(Age == &#39;All&#39;, `Migration Type` != &#39;Net&#39;, Sex == &#39;All&#39;) %&gt;% select(DateCode, Value,`Migration Source`, `Migration Type`) ggplot(traffic_scot2, aes(DateCode, Value, shape = `Migration Source`, colour = `Migration Type`)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2002,2018), breaks = c(2002:2018)) 8.9 Saving plots If you want to save your plot to your working directory, you can use the function ggsave. First, you have to save your plot into an object in the Global Environment. # Save your plot to the Global Environment. plot1 &lt;- ggplot(traffic_scot2, aes(DateCode, Value, shape = `Migration Source`, colour = `Migration Type`)) + geom_point() + geom_line() # Then save it to your working directory folder ggsave(&#39;myplot.png&#39;, plot1, width = 9 , height = 6) 8.10 Summative Homework The fourth summative assignment is available on moodle now.

Able to correct some of the more common errors found in R code. Know where to go online to find help and continue your coding journey on your own. This lesson is led by Rebecca Lai. 9.1 Errors: How to avoid some and live through the rest I don’t know a single person who can produce 100% correct code on the first attempt. It’s even common to produce code that runs, only for you to find out later that there were errors. Not all errors prevent code from running! This is a lesson focused on how to find and correct it when they happen- and they often do. 9.2 Debugging A literal bug in a machine, often incorrectly cited as the source of the term “debugging”. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging. Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from your code. It sounds a bit technical, but you’ve probably been doing it already. What you do to identify errors depends on what is wrong. There are various types of messages that R will give you that will help you identify the issues that you are having. Reading these error messages will come naturally after you get a bit more experience under your belt, but in the meantime let’s look at common problems. 9.2.1 Messages from R Occasionally, R will return some text when you run a piece of code. Often, this text is coloured red, which causes a bit of panic in newer users. It is printed in the console, but also may be displayed below code chunks in R Markdown documents. It is important to note that not all red text indicates an error! There are a number of things that R could be trying to tell you, all that the red colour indicates is that you should be paying attention to it. Let’s have a look at what different types of thing R could be telling you when you get a text output. 9.2.2 Error Messages These are definitely the ones that people worry about the most, but error messages given information about what has gone wrong. By reading and interpreting these messages we can diagnose the problem and fix it- a process called debugging. Let’s do something that will definitely generate an error and have a look at it: demo &lt;- read_cvs(&quot;some_file_name.csv&quot;) ## Error in read_cvs(&quot;some_file_name.csv&quot;): could not find function &quot;read_cvs&quot; Breaking it down: Error...: error messages are always preceded by the word error could not find function \"read_cvs\": the content of the error message. In this case the function I have tried to call is not found. Error messages should give a hint as to what has gone wrong. You will gain more experience in reading and interpreting these messages over time, most of us have just seen them a lot in our own work and have become accustomed to it! Trying to run a piece of code that results in an error will not produce any output, besides the error message. This means that any objects you try to create or processes that you try to run, will not be created or run. It is possible to write code which is valid, but does not do what you expect it to do! In this case, no error messages are produced, but the final outcome is still “incorrect”- that is, it is not the outcome that you anticipated. For this reason, you should always check that the outcome you have gotten from a line or segment of code is what you expected to get! For example, this might happen if you try to use filter(variable &gt; 150), which would retain all observations where the values in variable were greater than 150, when you actually mean to use filter(variable &lt; 150) to get rid of all observations where the values in variable were greater than 150 (retaining those below 150). Question Time Your turn We have some error messages below- let’s look at them and see if we can solve them. If you want you can download cars_for_sale.csv and test them out as we go. Could not find function: 1 demonstration &lt;- read_cvs(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) ## Error in read_cvs(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;): could not find function &quot;read_cvs&quot; What do you think this error message means? How is it fixed? Solution demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) # We tried to run the function read_cvs()- this doesn&#39;t # exist! Again, it might seem trivial, but R really # wont know what this means. Could not find function: 2 demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) ## Error in read_cvs(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;): could not find function &quot;read_csv&quot; What do you think this error message means? How is it fixed? Solution demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) # We tried to run the function read_csv(), but if tidyverse # is not loaded then this function, which is part of tidyverse, # is not available for use. # We need to run library(tidyverse) before we can use it Unexpected ‘)’ library(tidyverse)) ## Error: &lt;text&gt;:1:19: unexpected &#39;)&#39; ## 1: library(tidyverse)) ## ^ What does the error message tell you? What happened and what do you think I should do to fix it? Solution library(tidyverse) # There was an extra ) in there. It might seem trivial, # but this prevented the line of code from being run. # This can happen with any function that uses brackets, # but also with other symbols such as &quot;,&quot;. Not in current working directory demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) ## Error: &#39;cars_for_sale.csv&#39; does not exist in current working directory (&#39;C:/Users/gabym/OneDrive - University of Glasgow/Intro_to_R&#39;). What do you think this error means? We have all seen it at least once. I see it all the time because I always forget to do something when I start working. Solution If you are coding along and have correctly set your working directory before trying to replicate this error… you won’t see the error! Well done! demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) # We tried to run the function read_csv() and to read # cars_for_sale.csv, but in this instance the file was # not in the current working directory # to fix this we can go to the Session Menu, Set Working # Directory and Choose Directory to tell R where this file # can be found Could not find object head(demonstration) ## Error in head(demonstration): object &#39;demonstration&#39; not found I’ve tried to use the function head on the object I tried to create above. Have a think about why this error has been returned and how to fix it. Solution head(demonstration) # This code is correct, but errors can be cumulative... # that is, if a later piece of code is contingent on a # previous piece of code running successfully then # the later piece of code won&#39;t work if the earlier # one wasn&#39;t run! # The previous code creating the object had many errors, # one loading tidyverse into the library which is # necessary for the `read_csv()` function to be usable # and the second was a typo in the `read_csv()` function, # so the object `demonstration` was not created, and # thus there is no object to call using `head()` Code won’t run, + in the console demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot; This error appears in the console as below: What has happened? How do I fix it? Solution demonstration &lt;- read_csv(&quot;cars_for_sale.csv&quot;) ## Error: &#39;cars_for_sale.csv&#39; does not exist in current working directory (&#39;C:/Users/gabym/OneDrive - University of Glasgow/Intro_to_R&#39;). # This time there is a missing bracket at the end! # This means R is still expecting some kind of input. # It&#39;s kinda like talking to someone but forgetting to # finish the sentence! The person listening will be # confused because they expected a bit more. # To get rid of the +, click in the console then # press the escape key (&quot;esc&quot;, top-left of the keyboard) # until you see the more familiar &gt; symbol. # Next, correct the code by giving R what it expected # you to finish with, in this case the closing ). # Run the code again to create the object. 9.2.3 Multiple Errors If you have an error in your script on an earlier line, and have code later which depends on the success of running this earlier line, then you are also going have problems. Later code which might otherwise work would be missing a key component which would cause errors further down. Sometimes finding the source of an error requires you to go back to look through your previous code. Keep this in mind when debugging! For example: libraary(tidyverse) fails to load the appropriate package containing the function we need (read_csv()), which then means we do not load the data file we want. You can help prevent this sort of thing from happening by running all lines of code individually, rerunning later code after you’ve made changes to earlier code and periodically restarting the R session and running all code from the beginning. Find the error location by following the trail set out in the error message. Where did the code stop running correctly? When did the error message appear in the console or in the .Rmd outputs? What does the error message say? These pieces of information should allow you to find the location of the error and solve it successfully. 9.2.4 Finding errors in longer code segments The above examples are the most simple examples of debugging that you are likely to get. If these are the only ones you encounter, you will be incredibly lucky! We’ve been learning to use longer segments of code- not only single lines as in the example above… this can make it more difficult to find and diagnose errors. Let’s look at some error messages in longer examples and discuss some of the strategies that you might want to use to make your life easier. 9.2.4.1 Errors in Pipes As we saw before, pipes allow us to chain multiple functions together. For a recap of pipes, see the section on pipes in lecture 4. This makes life a lot easier, if the code works. If there is an error, it makes debugging a little more difficult as we need to establish which line the error occurs in. Let’s get a working example going, and we’ll use some of the data built in to the tidyverse called starwars so we don’t need to import any new data. let’s look at it: library(tidyverse) head(starwars) ## # A tibble: 6 x 13 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year gender ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke~ 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, bl~ red 33 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 Dart~ 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male ## 5 Leia~ 150 49 brown light brown 19 female ## 6 Owen~ 178 120 brown, gr~ light blue 52 male ## # ... with 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt; This is the data on the characters in the Star Wars universe (I have no idea if it counts the newer movies). Let’s look at this (faulty) code which counts the number of each species and their genders featured then arranges them by number in descending order: species_count &lt;- starwars %&gt;% group_by(starwars, species, gender) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) ## Error: Column `starwars` is unknown What is the best way to find out which part is wrong? Going through it a bit at a time will help you! We can do this by first highlighting the first line before the first pipe and then pressing Ctrl+Enter. this will run only that line of code: OK, we can see that we now have an object called species_count in the environment, and this now contains the data set starwars. The code ran, and ran as we expected it to. Let’s move on to the second line. Highlight the first two lines before the second pipe, again this will only run the first two lines of code: ## Error: Column `starwars` is unknown There we go, the location of the error is uncovered! We can now look at what is going on in line 2 and figure out what is going on. Question Time From the text of the error message that the error relates to the column name starwars, so we look at parts called starwars in our code. We have already established that the first time this appears (in line 1) that the code runs and runs as we expected it to, so the error is in line 2. Let’s look at line 2 in more detail. We know that: the result of line 1 (the entire data frame starwars) is run and then is put into the first argument of the second line’s function group_by() normally takes a data frame as its first argument so we only need to specify the grouping variables because the data argument is already specified by the pipe. Given the information above and the text of the error message, who knows what is happening? What would the correct code be? Solution We tried to re-specify the data frame argument in the group_by() function on the second line. Because the pipe operator already does this, the function then interprets the extra starwars as a column to group by. There is no column called that in the data frame, so we get an error message saying that there is no column called starwars. ## Error: Column `starwars` is unknown This would be the correct code to use: species_count &lt;- starwars %&gt;% group_by(species, gender) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) This is a common error for those who are new to using pipelines in their code. 9.2.4.2 Errors in ggplot() ggplot() errors can be difficult to diagnose for the same reason that pipeline errors can be- there are multiple lines of code! Let’s get an example of a plot to work with. We’ll use the built in data set called mpg. The following plot looks at data on fuel consumption. More specifically it shows the relationship between city fuel consumption (on the x axis) and highway fuel consumption (on the y axis), with a “line of best fit” to demonstrate the correlation between them. Vehicles of different classes are specified in different colours according to the legend on the right of the graph. Plots are made by code, and like all the other code, it can be subject to the same errors from misplaced or missing brackets, commas and non-existent objects in the environment. We won’t be looking at these here because they’ve been covered above and you should be able to extrapolate that information when the same error occurs under different circumstances. Let’s look at a few errors that can occur specifically when creating plots: ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F, colour = &quot;black&quot;) geom_bar(aes(colour = class)) + labs (x = &quot;City MPG&quot;, y = &quot;Highway MPG&quot;) Here is the code to recreate the graph presented above, but I’ve created 3 errors in it. These are probably the most common errors you will encounter. Question Time Let’s look at fixing these 3 errors. As a bonus, the same method used in debugging pipes is also used. The data set mpg is built in to tidyverse, so if you want to code and test the issues to see if you resolve them please do. stat_smooth requires the following missing aesthetics: y This is our first attempt at replicating the graph above. This time we have three errors, two with error messages (currently), but let’s focus only on the first one for now. The error message that appears first in the console is the one that happens first in the code and error messages can be cumulative- even if we correct the second one it still might not work because of the earlier code. When I run this code, I get the following print out in the console, indicating the errors that have occurred: ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F, colour = &quot;black&quot;) geom_bar(aes(colour = class)) + labs (x = &quot;City MPG&quot;, y = &quot;Highway MPG&quot;) ## Error: stat_smooth requires the following missing aesthetics: y geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F, colour = &quot;black&quot;) ## Error: Cannot add ggproto objects together. Did you forget to add this object to a ggplot object? Let’s do the same thing that we did with pipes, highlight the first line and run it. This time we don’t stop at a pipe, because there is no pipe, we stop before the +. OK, so this produces the first layer of the graph- the background with a scale on the axis. What do you think is going on here? There is a hint available at this stage. Compare the axes on the graph we are aiming to produce versus the axes you have on this sample. If you are still not sure, do the same thing with the second line of the code, this is where the error message is produced in the code and this should provide you with extra information. Solution You are attempting to plot a “line of best fit” to show a correlation between two variables, and those two variables should be presented on each of the axes. The erroneous code specifies only one axis (the x axis). The correct code also specifies the missing y axis: # first two lines should read: ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F, colour = &quot;black&quot;) Cannot add ggproto objects together. Did you forget to add this object to a ggplot object? Here you can clearly see that I have 2 geom layers, but only the geom_smooth is showing (that’s the line of the correlation between the variables on the x and y axes). ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y= hwy)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F, colour = &quot;black&quot;) geom_bar(aes(colour = class)) + labs (x = &quot;City MPG&quot;, y = &quot;Highway MPG&quot;) ## Error: Cannot add ggproto objects together. Did you forget to add this object to a ggplot object? Let’s do the same thing that we did with pipes, highlight the first line and run it. As above, we don’t stop at a pipe we stop before the +. Did it do as we expected it to do? Keep moving down the code segment line by line until you find where the result deviates from what we were expecting. What was the problem in this case? How do we solve this? Solution The + symbol was missing at the end of the line geom_smooth(). This means that ggplot() didn’t know to add the extra layers to the graph! stat_count() must not be used with a y aesthetic. Now that the previous error is fixed we can have a look at the next one. ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y= hwy)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(colour = class)) + labs (x = &quot;City MPG&quot;, y = &quot;Highway MPG&quot;) ## Error: stat_count() must not be used with a y aesthetic. stat_count() is another way of producing a geom_bar() style of graph. With this in mind, what do you think is wrong with the code segment? Do you think a bar graph is a good way to demonstrate the relationship between two sets of continuous values? Have a think and figure out what the problem is now. Run each line of code individually and see where the problem is coming from. Solution If we want to display individual data points a bar graph would be the wrong type of geom to use, as these produce counts and not individual points for each data point. instead of using geom_bar() we should have used geom_point() or geom_jitter(). 9.2.5 Warning Messages Warning messages are another type of message that you might encounter. Warning messages aren’t quite errors, but aren’t as benign as other types of textual outputs in the console. A warning will not halt the execution of code that you are running, but will allow the code to run. A warning message should spur you to checking if the function(s) you have tried to run have done so correctly. 9.2.6 Other Messages There are also other types of textual output, too numerous to classify here. Here is an example that you should have been seeing on a regular basis by this stage: This informs us that by using the code library(tidyverse) we have loaded in the packages listed under the sections that says Attaching Packages. tidyverse is, after all, a collection of other packages. It also informs us that there are some conflicts- this usually panics people! This section indicates that the function filter(), as part of the dplyr package within tidyverse, is masking another function with the same name which is part of the stats package, a part of base R. The same with lag(). This just means that when you use the functions filter() or lag() it will be the tidyverse versions that are used as default. You can still use the others, you just need to specify stats::filter() or stats::lag() if you do want to use these. Even though these functions use the same name, they do not perform the same function! stats::filter() and stats::lag() are both concerned with time series analysis, not with data wrangling! 9.3 Searching for Help Online There are multiple places online where you can search for help. 9.3.1 Googling It The first thing you should do with an error is to Google it. It sounds daft, but if you are having an issue there is probably someone on the internet who has also had that same problem. The main thing that you need to remember is that you need to include the right level of information in your query: * searching for “R code not working” will not get you information which is specific enough. * searching for “R” and the text given in the error message will give you a lot more, but some error message text can be the same for different functions. * searching for “R”, the text given in the error message and the name of the function that is giving that error message will give you a lot more, specific information. Learning to Google with appropriate levels of detail in your question is a skill in itself! We know this because we were in exactly the same position as you when we were first learning- and we still frequently Google things! 9.3.2 Stack Overflow Stack Overflow is a useful site for discussion and asking for help from experts. It is a community for professional coders, and operates on a reputation-based system. There are already huge numbers of questions there that have been answered that you can search through, but if your question is novel or unique you might want to ask there. 9.3.3 YouTube YouTube has a number of free video tutorials that you might want to check out now that you’ve had an introduction from us. Sometimes hearing the information from a different perspective, or hearing it explained in a different way, can help you understand it better. 9.3.4 Further Reading Look at the appendices section of this site to see some further reading materials to expand on the knowledge you’ve gained in this course. 9.4 Formative Exercises Now that we have completed the stuff for the in-class, we can move on to the formative exercises. Try the first couple in class (time permitting) and discuss them with those sitting near you if you wish or Rebecca. Download the .zip folder cars.zip from Moodle. Extract the files and open the file cars_formative.Rmd. In this file there are 6 error diagnosis and correction questions. When you are done there is a file called cars_solutions.Rmd in this same zip folder. Use this to check your answers. If you have questions you can ask on the Moodle forum. "],

First 30 min is time for you to ask any questions you have, clarify whatever you want to have clarified, etc. Then we will have an in-class practice exam that is structured fairly similar to the homework. Think about it: Either they do it themselves for 1 hour, and then we’ll go through possible solutions at the end, or run each question with guidance, as in how would you answer it, give you 5 min to think about it, then we’ll discuss. I like the idea of pair-programming (or pairs and a group of 3): give them a task to discuss and do together for a short time, then go over it as a class and discuss everyone’s thinking before repeating the process for the rest of the questions. All the time making sure they are taking notes/commenting their code and the code they get from the answer - Rebecca 10.2 In-class practice exam "],

Also, if your eyesight is not great, the effect can be multiplied and stressful. You can change the appearance of RMarkdown, and many of us who spend hours on it usually do. If you wish to change the appearance you can go to the tools menu and select “Global Options”: Next, click “Appearance” in the box on the left: Here you can change the Editor font, font size and the editor theme (the colours of the text). Make the selections you want and then press “Apply” to make them stick. Changing the “zoom” to too big a size can make it extremely difficult to use the software or to even change it back. Edit the font size and only tinker with the zoom when absolutely neccessary! Source Materials This course has been remixed from the following sources.
